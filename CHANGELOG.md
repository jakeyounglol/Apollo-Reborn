# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [v3.8.5] - 2026-09-29

### Features

- Add **Google Search** to the Search tab: tap the magnifier and pick Google to find Reddit threads through Google, with its snippets, Any Time and Exact Words filters, and results that open natively in Apollo (#1260: @icpryde)
- Open the fullscreen image viewer's **Copy / Save / Share** menu where you press and hold, instead of the middle of the screen (#1254: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add **Toon Bot** and **Happy Toon Bot** to the Concepts icon pack (#1253: @IllIIllIllIllII)

### Performance

- Make Apollo lighter on memory and quicker to launch: image caches now have size limits and are freed when iOS runs low on memory, the Deleted Comments and sidebar text hooks stay idle when they aren't needed, editing a comment no longer holds up other loads for up to 20 seconds, and launch does less work (#1169: @paradoxally, @icpryde)
  - Also stops the comments title flashing on non-Liquid-Glass builds, and makes **Remember Post Sort** open posts from links, the inbox, or Floating Post Tabs in your saved sort straight away instead of reloading them
- Stop the **AI comment summary** from re-running over and over while you scroll a thread (#1270: @Thetromboneman1)
- Stop filtered posts leaving stacks of gray gaps in feeds, correcting just the affected rows instead of redrawing the whole feed (#1274: @Thetromboneman1)

### Fixes

- Fix a feed **crash** when several RedGIFs posts load at once, most often right after launching or switching accounts (#1251: @icpryde)
- Fix a crash tapping "Translated from…" on a recovered **deleted comment** (#1222: @icpryde)
- Fix **RedGIFs** posts showing "RedGIFs error" on every post after switching Wi-Fi, cellular, or VPN, and on older RedGIFs videos with no listed length (#1256, #1258: @icpryde)
- Fix **API-Key-Free** feeds getting stuck on a spinner: avatar lookups no longer use up Reddit's request limit for your session (#1220: @icpryde)
- Keep avatar and subreddit lookups on the active account, so avatars stop staying blank and follow and subscribe states are right when you have several accounts signed in (#1227: @icpryde)
- Fix **Add Account** signing in with the active account's saved API key instead of the one set in Settings (#1237: @icpryde)
- Explain what went wrong when Reddit rejects your API key during sign-in, instead of leaving a blank "{}" page (#1236: @icpryde)
- Fix **Invalid Backup** when restoring backups made on 3.7.x and earlier (#1217: @icpryde)
- Fix **Unmute Videos** swapping the sound between two playing feed videos on every frame, starting videos with sound from feeds you already left, and playing on with sound under a different fullscreen video (#1247, #1250, #1252: @icpryde)
- Fix a post's video going grey, and the video scrubber not working, after opening the OP's profile or swiping forward back into the post (#1269: @icpryde)
- Fix **Swipe Past Gallery to Navigate** only acting after you lift your finger, sometimes on the wrong thread: swiping past a feed gallery's first or last image now goes straight to your post swipes (vote, save, back, or forward) (#1271: @Thetromboneman1)
- Fix tapping a post sometimes opening a gallery post from further up the feed with **Swipe Through Feed Galleries** on (#1248: @icpryde)
- Fix **Gallery View** only playing the first video when swiping on CarPlay (CarBridge/CarCast) (#1257: @icpryde)
- Fix **Download Video** sending the first video you shared again over Messages, and clean up the downloaded copies it left behind (#1216, #1219: @icpryde)
- Reserve room for **inline comment images** up front, so comments no longer grow when the image finishes loading (#1273: @Thetromboneman1)
- Explain why a **comment** couldn't post, such as the post being removed (and where the mods' reason is), the thread being locked or archived, the parent comment being removed, or a ban, instead of "Reddit had a little hiccup" (#1275: @icpryde)
- Fix a just-posted **image comment** showing "[Unknown Image]" under the picture (#1246: @icpryde)
- Keep the newest message above the reply bar in **modmail** and message threads on iOS 26 and 27, and bring the reply bar back after a cancelled swipe-back between threads (#1228, #1234: @icpryde)
- Fix the **post composer**'s Post button turning white on Liquid Glass, the Media body editor's checkmark turning into Post as you type, and Command-Return submitting from the body editors instead of acting as Done (#1221, #1226, #1233: @icpryde)
- On Liquid Glass, keep a scrolled-away feed **search bar** hidden after swiping back from a post, and the Search tab's placeholder dim after Cancel (#1249, #1261: @icpryde)
- Fix **interactive posts**' Subscribe button doing nothing when Reddit needs your permission first, and keep Apollo's Join button and Subscriptions list in sync when a post subscribes you (#1264: @icpryde)
- Put the post header's **translation** marker after the edited pencil instead of on top of it (#1259: @icpryde)
- Keep feed avatars out of post titles that name their own author (#1218: @icpryde)
- Show old-reddit sprite **user flairs** on every row of the flair picker again (#1215: @icpryde)
- Stop **Random** and **RandNSFW** sometimes opening an empty feed that never loads (#1272: @Thetromboneman1)
- Fix tapping a multireddit's expand arrow in the Subreddits list asking to change a favorite, and style expanded multireddit rows like the rest of the list (#1229: @nunoo)
- Fix the Subreddits list's **Edit** mode putting moderator hide controls on the wrong rows and jumping the list up after Edit or Done (#1262: @icpryde)
  - Swiping a row no longer turns on Edit controls, and stars stay put in Edit mode with Subreddit List Enhancements off
- Open the multireddit editor in the Subreddits list's Edit mode again when Multireddits isn't the second section (#1267: @icpryde)
- Make **settings section headers** match across Apollo's and Apollo Reborn's settings on iOS 26 and later, in one Title Case style that follows Text Size and your theme (#1241: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix **Settings Shortcuts**' Remove button not removing the shortcut (#1212: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Make **Pixel Pals** follow the real Dynamic Island on iPhone 18 Pro and newer (#1244: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **Open in Apollo (Legacy)** in Safari doing nothing without Link Companion installed (#1268: @Thetromboneman1)
- Stop the **Social Links** row sometimes showing Reddit's copyright footer instead of a profile's links (#1231: @icpryde)
- Stop forwarding Apollo's analytics to your **Notification Backend** when one is set; they're now always blocked (#1230: @DeltAndy123)

## [v3.8.0] - 2026-09-25

### Features

- Add **Save All Media** to save every image, GIF, and video in a Reddit gallery, Imgur album, or ImageChest post at once, from the fullscreen viewer's menus or an album's long-press menu, with a progress ring and Cancel (#1048: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Fullscreen images offer Save Image next to Share, and holding an image in the viewer or a feed gallery offers Copy Image and Save Image for that image instead of jumping straight to the share sheet
  - Also fixes **Download Video** when only Reddit's copy is available, **Save GIF** in the share sheet, and missing post controls on albums opened from a link in a post
- Add **Action Menus** (Interface → Menus) to reorder and hide the actions in Apollo's ••• menus and, for moderators, its moderator menus, one menu at a time with a live preview (#1131: @icpryde)
- Redesign the **Account Switcher** as a themed bottom sheet with larger avatars, Add Account and Edit at the top, and drag-to-reorder that no longer refreshes your feed (#1077: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Also fixes a crash when switching accounts
- Add **Automatic Backups** (Data → Backup Settings) — pick a folder in Files and your settings are backed up there every day, three days, or seven days, keeping the ten most recent automatic backups (#1060, #1148, #1152: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Backups now save as `.apollobackup` files with the Apollo icon, and opening one from Files asks before restoring; existing `.zip` backups still restore
- Add **Settings Shortcuts** — press and hold the Settings tab to jump straight to up to 15 settings pages, chosen and reordered under Interface → Tab Bar → Settings Shortcuts (#1150: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add a **Return Button** that appears beside Back after a status-bar tap takes you to the top; tap it, or the status bar again, to jump back to where you were reading, now on Liquid Glass too (#1116: @icpryde, @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Turn the button off under Interface → Display & Navigation; the second status-bar tap keeps working either way
- Rework **Hidden & Deleted** into a profile row that opens one combined feed of archived posts and comments, labeled Hidden, Removed, or Deleted, with inline images and swipeable albums (#1137: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add **Profile Picture Shape** (Interface → Display & Navigation) to show profile pictures as Full, Circle, or rounded Square across posts, comments, messages, the profile tab, and the Account Switcher (#1136: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Extend **Immersive** profile artwork behind the status and navigation bars with a wider crop and smoother fade, and long-press a profile banner to view it fullscreen and save it (#1186: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Play GIF and video tiles silently in **Gallery View**'s grid while they're on screen, with separate **Play Videos in Gallery View** and **Play GIFs in Gallery View** switches (Media → Browsing, on by default) (#1142: @icpryde)
- Speed up opening and closing **images and albums** — albums zoom straight out of the feed thumbnail like single images, the background fades as you swipe media away, and closing an album returns the feed carousel to the last image you viewed (#1143: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Smooth out scrolling through **video-heavy feeds** — playing videos take far less of the app's time, and the new **Smoother Video Scrolling** switch (Posts & Feeds → Feed, on by default) prepares players in the background and lets video posts draw without stalling the scroll (#1168: @icpryde)
- Keep unsent **Chat** drafts in modern Direct Chat, saved per account and conversation and restored when you come back (#1207: @Thetromboneman1)
- Add **Swipe Tab Bar to Navigate** (Interface → Tab Bar, Liquid Glass, off by default) to swipe the tab bar back and forward again in place of the native drag-to-switch-tabs gesture; takes effect after relaunching (#1075: @DeltAndy123)
- Add **Confirm Favorite Changes** (Subreddits → Favorites, off by default) so the star on the Subreddits list asks before adding or removing a favorite (#1173: @nunoo)

### Fixes

- Fix a **startup crash loop** after adding an account while Reddit is rate-limiting; an unexpected listing response now fails like any other load (#1147: @icpryde)
- Fix a crash on launch or when switching accounts after changing your **Reddit password**; Apollo now tries to recover the expired session and asks you to sign in again if it can't (#1200: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix crashes loading older comments in **Live Update** mode and choosing Open in Safari on a shared GIF or other downloaded media (#1171: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix a crash when touching and holding a post while the feed scrolls (#1193: @icpryde)
- Fix a crash tapping **Cancel** on a subreddit search with results on non-Liquid-Glass builds (#1133: @icpryde)
- Bring back **Copy with Account** in Copy Widget Setup Code, lost in 3.7.1, so Home and multireddit widgets can use your account again (#1195: @icpryde)
- Fix **Gallery View** hiding its first row of tiles under the navigation bar since 3.7.1, and its spinner staying up after changing the filter while it loads (#1140, #1194: @icpryde)
  - Holding a video in the viewer opens Save/Share without letting go, and dragging down with that sheet open no longer leaves the viewer black and unresponsive
- Fix the Liquid Glass **feed search bar** springing back open after you scroll it away, staying pinned when you scroll right after cancelling a search, and the Hard header style cutting off the top of the field (#1130, #1146: @icpryde)
  - Collapsing a comment no longer jumps the thread or flashes a band across the top, Find in Comments swaps its buttons smoothly, and a cancelled swipe-back keeps the search field's glass
- Keep the **Settings** search field below the title while searching on Liquid Glass instead of sliding up over it (#1156: @icpryde)
- Make **Apollo Reborn settings** follow Apollo's Text Size and match the native rows' font weight and text colors, including the softer gray in Pure Black mode (#1165: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix Apollo Reborn settings screens stuttering or refusing to scroll back up, footer text drawing over the rows above it, and the list shifting after a swipe back (#1170: @icpryde)
- Soften the **row highlight** when you tap a row — stock themes use Apollo's original gray again and custom themes a lighter tint of their accent (#1166: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix **subreddit list editing** — favorite stars stay aligned, long names stop short of the star, confirmation buttons stay tappable, rows no longer stay highlighted, and removals animate smoothly (#1174: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Keep the header visible while editing the subreddit list with **Hide Header on Scroll** on, and bring the header and tab bar back as soon as you tap the status bar (#1120: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix a brief stall when scrolling back down right after reaching the top of a post, and a stutter where Hide Header on Scroll kept hiding and revealing the header (#1119: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Make the **Posts** tab scroll to the top and then go back on profiles, trophies, multireddits, and posts opened from a profile, like it does on feeds (#1153: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix a cancelled forward swipe erasing your navigation history, so swiping forward again reopens the page (#1128: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Reopen **Floating Post Tabs** on the comment sort you left them on, Live Update included, instead of the default sort (#1125: @icpryde)
- Fade a newly **posted comment** into the thread with its avatar and flair already in place, instead of the thread jumping and the avatar popping in afterwards (#1196: @icpryde)
- Fix collapsing a comment thread sliding its replies down before the comments below move up (#1180: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Keep the **comment age** visible next to long usernames, which now truncate instead (#1162: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Keep recovered **deleted comments** readable when Apollo switches between light and dark mode while the thread is open (#1206: @Thetromboneman1)
- Fix feed usernames drifting right, leaving a growing gap after "by", each time you came back to the feed from a post with Translate Post Titles on (#1208: @icpryde)
- Fix **rich link cards** overlapping a post's details and vote buttons once they finish loading, in feeds and comment threads, including while you scroll (#1191: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix the composer's **GIF** button staying over username and subreddit suggestions, and the formatting toolbar sitting partly behind the keyboard on iOS 27, on non-Liquid-Glass builds (#1164: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix a **Chat** conversation you opened from the Inbox turning unread again, badge included, after a refresh when Use Modern Reddit Chat is on (#1141: @icpryde)
- Fix double-tapping the **Search** tab sometimes not opening the keyboard (#1190: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Show the gallery counter in its usual top-right spot on the **iPhone 18 Pro** and Pro Max instead of centered (#1189: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix **Bark Notifications** showing Bark's own icon when your app icon has no Bark artwork; they fall back to the default Apollo icon instead (#1204: @Thetromboneman1)
- Turn **Swipe Up for Comments** off by default (Media → Browsing); if you already switched it on or off, your choice is kept (#1134: @icpryde)

## [v3.7.1] - 2026-09-13

### Features

- Add **Hide Header on Scroll** (Interface → Tab Bar) so the Liquid Glass navigation bar follows the tab bar as it hides and reappears, in both Two-Gesture and Classic scroll modes (#1079: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Hide Bars on Scroll, Hide Style, Hide Header on Scroll, and Scroll Behavior are separate controls now, and Hide Style, Scroll Behavior, and Header Style pick from native glass menus that show the current choice in the row
  - Gallery View honors the selected Header Style while scrolling and after the bars come back, instead of leaving an opaque strip under the navigation controls

### Fixes

- Fix **swipe navigation** feeling sluggish since 3.7.0 — pages settle with Apollo's original easing again after you lift your finger, on back, forward, and cancelled swipes (#1073: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix the **comment jump button** stalling on the first parent comment since 3.7.0 — consecutive taps advance again without scrolling past the current comment first, and long-press to jump back uses the corrected position (#1094: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix posts opened from **Community Highlights**, deep links, Recently Read, Floating Post Tabs, and other `apollo://` routes ignoring the subreddit's suggested sort and your Remember Post Sort and Remember Subreddit Sort choices — they now open on the same comment sort a feed tap would (#1102: @icpryde)
- Fix several **crashes**: opening 3.7.0 on TrollStore and other ElleKit installs, a profile page still loading when you switch accounts or refresh, expanding or collapsing a multireddit in the subreddit list, and the notification fetcher reading settings that had just been replaced (#1089: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Classic (non-glass) builds running under LiveContainer no longer mistake themselves for Liquid Glass builds, the suspected cause of crashes opening search, settings, posts, and subreddits there
- Keep **Liquid Glass** builds from crashing when a feed element's bitmap can't be created, seen when tapping the Posts tab to return to the top of a long Popular feed; the element is left blank instead (#1099: @icpryde)
- Fix **Keep in Floating Tab** and the other Apollo Reborn rows in the legacy ⋯ sheet crashing the app when a third-party menu tweak such as Translomatic is installed (#1076: @icpryde)
- Fix **videos going quiet** after rotating the phone with the fullscreen viewer open, and stop a second video under the viewer from starting its own audio (#1080: @icpryde)
- Fix **Add to Multireddit** reporting "Error adding to multireddit" even though the subreddit was added, and the multireddit's subtitle lagging until the next refresh (#1081: @icpryde)
- Keep the Liquid Glass action pill **expanded by default** again — collapsing it into the ⋯ is now the opt-in **Collapse Navigation Actions** switch (Interface → Display & Navigation), and **Center Title Between Buttons** is back for the expanded layout (#1105: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Titles stay centered unless the expanded actions need the room, the pill no longer flashes when the subreddit picker opens or closes, and a startup recursion on the always-expanded path is fixed
- Restore **Hidden** as a **Header Style** option on Liquid Glass — it removes the top scroll-edge effect without adding a blur, and existing Hidden preferences and backups work again (#1074: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix the Liquid Glass tab bar popping open and snapping back on iOS 27 when a **Two-Gesture** reveal starts with the Left or Right hide style (#1078: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Show the **+N new-comment count** on Community Highlights again after a refresh (#1098: @IllIIllIllIllII)

## [v3.7.0] - 2026-09-11

### Features

- Add **Floating Post Tabs** (Posts & Feeds → Floating Tabs, off by default) — keep up to five posts open as draggable bubbles from any post or feed ⋯ menu, and tap one to land exactly where you left off (#984, #1061: @icpryde)
  - Bubbles snap to the screen edges, tuck away when dragged past them, stack magnetically, and hold-to-preview the post; drop one on the ✕ to close it
  - Match threads wear the two teams' crests on their bubble, and two text posts from the same subreddit get a big letter each so they don't look like twins
- Add a **Feed Shortcuts** screen (Features → Subreddits) with Classic, Circle, Tinted, Soft Tile, and Solid Tile icon styles, Rows, Grid, Side-by-Side, and Icon Dock layouts, a live preview, and visibility toggles for Popular, All, and Moderator Posts (#988: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add a **Subreddit Sections** screen (Features → Subreddits) — give followed users their own FOLLOWING section with **Separate Followed Users**, drag Favorites, Multireddits, Moderator, and Following into any order, and watch a pinned live preview follow every change (#997, #1020: @icpryde)
  - Subreddit List Enhancements, Modern Subreddit Dividers, and Hide Multireddit Descriptions move here, and the A–Z index stays visible and themed with Enhancements off
- Add **Per-Account Favorites** and **Sort Favorites Alphabetically** (Subreddits → Favorites), so each account can keep its own subreddit favorites and keep them in A–Z order (#1017, #1042: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add Fade, Down, and Off styles to **Hide Bars on Scroll** for the Liquid Glass tab bar alongside Left and Right, plus a **Scroll Behavior** picker that restores Apollo's Classic one-gesture hide next to the Two-Gesture default (#972: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Interface settings regroup into Tab Bar and Display & Navigation, and Profile Layout opens straight from the Apollo Reborn hub
- Rework **Liquid Glass navigation** around a collapsible action pill — the ⋯ button expands into translate, moderator, sort, and more actions, so titles stay centered and stop resizing between screens (#1035, #1047: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Navigation buttons match the back button and title, moderator controls turn a brighter green with readable menu text, the pill collapses while subreddit search is open, and a cancelled swipe-back no longer jumps the page
  - Replaces the Center Title Between Buttons setting with automatic placement; standard builds keep their expanded actions
- Replace the Liquid Glass **feed search bar** with the native glass pill — it activates in place, compresses as you scroll, and reveals on a pull at the top, fixing the feed sliding under the field and the bar floating detached after cancel (#1002, #1026: @icpryde)
  - Results and the query survive opening a post, the quick-switcher's autocomplete highlight stays legible on near-white accents, and the bar is in place from the first frame when a feed re-appears at its top
  - Tapping the Posts tab scrolls to the top and a second tap returns to the subreddit list, including from followed-user profiles (#1021, #1040: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - The Keep Search Bar Visible setting is retired; in-place activation is simply how glass search works now
- Add **Bold Post Titles** (Appearance → Posts) — feed post titles in Semibold for large and compact posts, every theme and theme font, Liquid Glass or legacy chrome; flips live without a relaunch (#1033: @icpryde)
- Show read state on **Community Highlights** — unread dots, a New badge for posts under 24 hours old, a theme-colored +N count for comments added since your last visit, and dimmed titles once a highlight is read (#1041: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add a live **Profile Layout** preview for Immersive, Compact, and a restored Native layout that updates as you change avatar and visibility options, with optional pinning (#1034: @IllIIllIllIllII)
  - Also fixes copying your username on Immersive and Compact layouts and removes duplicated usernames on profiles
- Add pinned live previews to **Subreddit Layout** too — a header preview for the Immersive, Compact, and Native **Header Style**, a Community Highlights preview for Full, Partial, and Off, and separate User Flair, Sidebar, Subtitle, and Description toggles that update open subreddits without reopening them (#1019: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add **Microsoft Translator** as a bring-your-own-key translation provider, retry Google through a second endpoint when its free one rate-limits you, and show a Translation Limit Reached notice instead of silently giving up (#998: @icpryde)
  - Moves off the shut-down default LibreTranslate instance and names dead or redirected instances instead of failing quietly
- Add a **Source** picker to the Feed and Post **widgets** — Home, Popular, All, or a subreddit — and let every widget's subreddit field take several subreddits at once, a pasted link, or a multireddit (#1051: @icpryde)
  - Copy Widget Setup Code now offers a with-account code, which is what unlocks Home and your private multireddits
- Add pinned live previews to the **Inline Media** and **Rich Link Previews** settings screens that follow every control as you scroll, with tap to pin or unpin, and let the size and Apollo AI sliders select a stop from a tap (#1022, #1023, #1025: @icpryde)
- Add **Forget Forward Swipe After Scrolling** (Posts & Feeds, off by default) so a forward swipe stops reopening a post you backed out of many posts ago; **Swipe Past Gallery to Navigate** now defaults to off (#996: @icpryde)
- Improve **Find in Comments** — the selected match stays in view while rows load in, a comma-separated query matches any of its terms, and the docked bar follows the theme (#992, #1036: @icpryde)
  - On Liquid Glass it is now the same native search bar the feed uses: it activates in place, the match count sits inside the field, and the More pill turns into up and down chevrons while a search is live
- Add nine never-released **Ultra** icons — Safari, Space Paws, Grumpy Space Paws, and sequels to Explorer of Smiles, Gorilla Gus, The Little Prince, Under the Tree, and Wish Maker — move SPCA into Ultra, and list the EverythingApplePro Icons Drop Test icon in Sekrit (#969, #971, #989: @IllIIllIllIllII)

### Fixes

- Fix Apollo **freezing** on a loading spinner or a loaded comments screen when navigating between subreddits or opening posts on iOS 26 and later (#1024: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix **Gallery View** getting killed for memory on animated GIFs — GIFs now stream instead of holding every frame in RAM, and oversized stills are downsampled (#1001: @icpryde)
- Fix a launch crash when the trending-subreddits table can't be written (LiveContainer and other read-only setups), and a crash opening a feed on older iOS versions that lack ActivityKit, WeatherKit, or VisionKit (#968: @icpryde)
- Fix **Live Interactive Posts** — post-match threads render as normal text posts instead of an endless spinner, finished match threads no longer leave a hole in feed cards, the external-link confirmation works, and rotation relays out (#991, #1046: @icpryde)
  - Opening a live post from the feed hands its already-loaded widget to the thread instead of reloading it, widgets stay warm between feed and thread, and Apollo AI no longer tries to summarize the hidden fallback text under one
- Fix the in-app **Safari** browser flashing a white page while a link loads in dark mode; it stays black until content paints (#1052: @icpryde)
- Fix **Liquid Glass** top fades vanishing during tab switches, and make swipe-back track the nav bar so the title and search bar no longer snap to the previous screen the moment a swipe starts (#1018: @icpryde)
- Fix **Account Switcher** reordering quietly switching the signed-in account, plus drag handles that scrolled the page and rows that overlapped (#1011: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix duplicate items in **Saved** after a pull-to-refresh (#1005: @Thetromboneman1)
- Fix the **subreddit list**'s section headers overlapping rows and labels sliding into place during the launch animation (#979: @icpryde)
- Fix a subreddit's header and Community Highlights going missing after swiping forward back into it (#1037: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Fix the **translate globe** missing from search results under Liquid Glass (#1012: @icpryde)
- Keep **custom theme separators** themed — the comments action bar lines no longer revert to gray once the thread loads, and separators no longer reset after returning from the background (#990: @icpryde)
- Fix the **composer quick-bar** icons staying Apollo blue next to a themed GIF chip (#966, #987: @icpryde)
- Fix **Share > Copy Link** ignoring the Share Link Host setting (#970: @icpryde)
- Fix **Swipe Past Gallery to Navigate** missing real flicks on device (#974: @icpryde)
- Stop **Autoplay Inline GIFs** treating Low Power Mode as Tap to Play — Always and WiFi Only now keep GIFs animating in Low Power Mode, and Tap to Play or Never remain the battery-saving choices (#1016: @icpryde)
- Give **Show/Hide Deleted Comments** in the comments ⋯ menu custom icons that match Apollo's own artwork, and restore Apollo's original icon weight across the ⋯ menus, which the Liquid Glass menu had been downscaling (#985: @AcornElf, @icpryde)
- Fix the **Theme Manager** row in Appearance reverting to "Themes" after the Post Size sheet, and match its weight to the rows around it (#1032: @icpryde)
- Fix the oversized paragraph gaps in posts written with Reddit's fancy-pants editor, left behind when a zero-width space is stripped (#1050: @icpryde)
- Make the **Settings** search bar scroll away with the list again while staying visible on arrival, keep pull-to-search, and pad the first settings group (#975: @icpryde)
- Make the Inbox swipes track your finger, and swipe back inside a **Chat** conversation one level to the chat list instead of leaving the Inbox (#965: @icpryde)
- Show each **Chat** conversation once on the Inbox's Notifications side and open it in modern Chat instead of Apollo's legacy thread when Use Modern Reddit Chat is on, with the Inbox badge no longer counting an unread chat twice (#1038: @icpryde)
- Make the inline feed search bar usable on **Apple Vision Pro** (#978: @rebelancap)
- Center the subreddit list's A–Z index labels and keep the favorite star's touch area clear of the index (#981: @IllIIllIllIllII)

## [v3.6.0] - 2026-08-18

### Features

- Add **Gallery View** to the Home feed, Popular, All, Moderator Posts, and user profiles, with real video controls, rotation, and sort inherited from the feed you opened it from (#904: @icpryde)
  - Adds a universal "..." menu to your own profile holding Gallery View, Edit Profile, Recently Read, hidden and deleted content, and Share Profile, so the floating Edit pill and the nav-bar clock and eye icons are gone
- Add **Live Interactive Posts** so Reddit's Developer Platform posts — live match threads, games, and other custom widgets — render inline in comments and the feed instead of the "not supported on old Reddit" placeholder (#920, #939: @icpryde)

- Add a **Blur NSFW Media** setting with Reddit Setting, Always, and Never options, covering mature media while leaving the post title readable (#874: @jordanearle)

- Add swipe navigation between **Notifications and Chat** in the Inbox, and keep the title from sliding across when switching tabs (#900: @icpryde)
- Add **Prefer Native Images** to Comment Link Host, so comment images upload natively wherever a subreddit allows image comments and only fall back to the link host where it doesn't (#952: @icpryde)
- Add the **Right to Repair** app icon, overhaul the **Classics** Liquid Glass pack with more faithful recreations and four new icons, and refresh **Synthwave** (#888, #915, #927, #928: @IllIIllIllIllII, @bajader)
- Move **Icon-Only Tab Bar** under Settings > Interface alongside the rest of the tab bar options (#867: @JeffreyCA)

- Stop hidden scrape web views letting a Reddit video ad take over the screen while **Community Highlights**, Badge Book, Social Links, User Flair, or the sidebar load in the background (#908: @jordanearle)

- Fix **A–Z scrubbing** in the Subreddits list going dead mid-drag on non-Liquid-Glass builds, along with the black bands behind its section headers (#936: @icpryde)

- Fix **tweet previews** not rendering at all after x.com changed its guest-token flow, and show them on posts with 40 or fewer upvotes too (#873: @DeltAndy123)
- Fix **Picture in Picture** taking over for silent v.redd.it clips while Activate For is set to Unmuted Videos Only (#951: @JeffreyCA)
- Play more **sports clips** inline: add MLB's cuts-diamond CDN, restore streamain posters, and follow dubz's and streamin's split CDNs instead of assuming a single host (#929, #944: @icpryde)
- Fix Apollo's native **NSFW blur** ignoring your Reddit preference on API-Key-Free accounts, and the Search tab pill painting its light-mode color on dark themes (#866: @jordanearle)
- Fix **custom themes** greying out primary text in Pure Black Dark Mode and leaving the GIF and gallery-count pills unreadable on compact posts (#869: @DeltAndy123)
- Fix **Recently Read** opening with a black background and mis-sized stats, and apply custom theme text colors to the remaining tweak-owned settings rows that ignored them (#860: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix mature listings returning the placeholder user on **API-Key-Free** accounts configured with a custom User-Agent (#889: @Thetromboneman1)
- Fix cloud **AI Summaries** failing on newer OpenAI models, and bound streaming responses so a malformed endpoint can't exhaust memory (#887, #890: @Thetromboneman1, @jaredrossberg)
- Improve scrolling and launch smoothness by tightening shared-state synchronization and keeping cache serialization and image decoding off the critical path (#859: @ryannair05)
- Fix the **Public Sticky from Subreddit** row eating the gap above Cancel on the legacy "Notify user via..." sheet (#862: @DeltAndy123)

- Fix **posting, translation, and moderation** regressions including long composer titles, an unsafe Text editor Post button, untranslated media-post bodies, poll flair, search state, long translated titles, and incorrect moderator-row routing (#780, #793, #795, #835: @jordanearle, @icpryde)

- Add the **Synthwave** Liquid Glass app icon to the in-app icon picker (#663: @IllIIllIllIllII)

### Fixes

- Fix the **Reddit account** being signed out after force-quitting or backgrounding the app on sideloaded installs — the account's keychain item was written with the wrong protection class and became invisible to Apollo's own read, which then overwrote it as empty; the item is now created correctly, repaired in place on affected devices, and served from an enumeration fallback so the account survives (#677, #681, #682: @jordanearle, @DeltAndy123)
- Play more short-clip host links inline: add **streama.in** and **streamff.link** aliases and follow the moved **dubz** and **streamff** CDNs (#665: @icpryde)

- Play short-clip host links — **streamff, streamin, streamain, dubz, dropr, bangr, and MLB** clips — inline as real videos with autoplay, fullscreen, mute, and PiP, just like Streamable posts (#596: @icpryde)
- Replace **Hide Bars on Scroll** with a **Left / Right / Off** picker for the collapsed Liquid Glass tab bar (#645: @icpryde)
- Make the **account switcher** and **Custom API** settings reflect each account's actual sign-in mode and credentials instead of showing one global state (#603: @icpryde)

- Fix **Inline Media** crashes from repeated album links and leaving posts during resolution, reduce relayout lag, and show the fullscreen PiP button for inline and Markdown-linked videos (#638: @JeffreyCA)
- Remove the obsolete **"Subscribe to r/ApolloApp?"** prompt shown after a first sign-in (#614: @icpryde)
- Fix **X/Twitter links** ignoring the selected browser and always opening system Safari instead of In-App Safari when configured (#625: @icpryde)
- Fix **Color Flairs** reverting to grey with the wrong text color after returning from the background (#624: @icpryde)
- Fix **Discussion so far** AI summaries getting stuck on "Summarizing..." in Tap to Summarize mode (#610: @icpryde)
- Fix the iOS 26 **media-post composer** freezing when opening the "Text (optional)" editor (#623: @icpryde)

- Fix tapping a post's **comment count** opening at the top before jumping down, so it now lands directly at the action bar (#626: @icpryde)

- Fix bulk **Hide Read Posts** and unhide actions silently skipping 50 posts when processing more than 50 at once (#650: @icpryde)

## [v3.4.0] - 2026-07-08

### Features

- Replace **Theme Builder** with a redesigned **Theme Manager** in **Settings > Appearance > Theme Manager** — a unified hub with a 50-preset **Theme Gallery** (Dracula, Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Nord, Tokyo Night, and more), plus AI-generated, imported, and your own saved themes; gallery presets apply by reference and can be forked into editable copies, and a crash kill-switch preserves your last theme with one-tap re-enable (#558, #576: @jordanearle, theme presets by @harshb16)
- Add **Follow New Live Comments** for the Live Update sort — new comments pin to the top while you're at the live edge, and a floating **"N new comments"** pill lets you jump back to the newest without losing your reading position; toggle in **Settings > General** (#535: @icpryde)
- Add a **Magnify Info Row** loupe to the post stats strip — press and hold to pop up a card, then slide to pick an action (upvote, open comments, timestamp, upvote %, translate) and release to fire it; toggle in **Settings > General** (#566: @icpryde)
- Add an **Open in App** screen in **Settings > General** that consolidates all per-app deep-link toggles (Bluesky, GitHub, Steam, YouTube) and a **Default Browser** picker in one place (#547: @icpryde)
- Add a **Comment Link Host** picker in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Media Upload Host** to post comment images as plain Imgur or Img Chest links instead of native Reddit uploads, so you can add images in subreddits that disallow media comments (#573: @icpryde)
- Improve **Apollo AI Summaries** (#532: @icpryde)
  - Tapping an idle summary card now opens it automatically once the summary is ready
  - New **Open Summaries Automatically** toggle expands cards on completion (off by default)
  - Cards reopen in the state you last left them, tracked per thread
  - JavaScript-heavy pages are retried so they summarize instead of failing, and tapping a page with nothing to summarize now shows a **"Nothing to summarize"** card
  - Cached summaries now expire after 7 days
- Extend **Share as Video** to Streamable and Redgifs link posts, showing the correct full-width poster at the true aspect ratio and including audio in exported clips (#540: @icpryde)
- Make the **Hold for Video Speed** gesture configurable in **Settings > Media** — pick any speed from 0.25× to 2× to engage while holding, or turn the gesture off, with a haptic tick the instant it engages (#545, #531: @icpryde)
- Add a **Picture-in-Picture entry button** to the fullscreen video player so you can send a video to the in-app miniplayer directly when autoplay is off (#569: @JeffreyCA)
- Add three **LGBTQ+ Liquid Glass app icons** (Pride, Progress, Trans) to the icon picker (#529: @lilacvibes)
- Add **Move Tab Bar to Bottom** for iPad in **Settings > General** to dock the iPadOS 26 floating tab bar at the bottom instead of overlapping the search bar (#557: @icpryde)
- Add a **Show Detailed Profiles** toggle in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Media** (on by default) to revert profile pages to Apollo's compact stock layout, folding in the former "Social Links in Profile" switch (#536: @icpryde)
- Add a **Public Sticky from Subreddit** option to the moderator removal **Notify user via…** menu that posts the removal comment under the subreddit's mod-team identity instead of your own account (#537: @icpryde)
- Improve **subreddit feed search** with **Keep Search Bar in Place** on — results appear directly below the search field, the nav bar stays visible after opening a result and returning, and the subreddit header hides while searching to prevent Liquid Glass bleed-through (#534: @icpryde)
- Add **theme image sharing** to the Theme Manager — export any custom theme as a shareable QR card (a mock post preview of its colours and font) and import it back via Camera, Photo Library, or Files (#581: @icpryde)
- Add a **Colourize Vote Arrows** option to the Theme Manager so idle up/down arrows take the accent colour while a cast vote keeps Apollo's native green/blue-violet indicator (#580: @jordanearle)
- Extend the **theme accent colour** to all tweak-drawn UI — settings screens, the GIF picker, sign-in buttons, AI summaries, the follow pill, and more now follow the active theme's accent (or the stock theme's) instead of defaulting to blue, with legibility guards for near-white accents (#586: @JeffreyCA)
- Add a **Deleted Comments** settings sub-screen, a Show/Hide shortcut at the bottom of the comments ⋯ menu, and a new **Passive** mode that recovers deleted comments for a single thread on demand — switching back off when you leave — without touching the global toggle (#572: @icpryde)
- Add per-item **translation language markers** — tap a marker to toggle just that comment, post body, or feed title between translated and original, and enable a new **Tap to Translate** mode to translate only the items you tap (#564: @icpryde)
- Add **Bark Notifications** for free Apple ID sideloads — relay push notifications through the free Bark app, configured in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Custom API**, on builds without a push entitlement (#578: @nickclyde)
- Show the **Picture-in-Picture button** in the fullscreen player for spoiler- and NSFW-tagged videos, which never autoplay inline and so were previously missing the button even with autoplay off (#584: @JeffreyCA)
- Add **Helios Liquid Glass icon variants** — eight new app icons (Helios, plus Halo, Cryo, Parallax, and Ultra combinations) for the Liquid Glass icon picker (#590: @IllIIllIllIllII)
- Add an **Anonymous Install Count** heartbeat with a new **Settings > Privacy** section — an opt-out, once-a-day beacon that reports only a monthly-rotating random token, app version, build variant, and iOS version so the project can gauge real active-user numbers without tracking anyone (#589: @jordanearle)

### Fixes

- Fix muted **Picture-in-Picture** videos pausing background music when **Enable PiP When Leaving App** is on — PiP now only claims the audio session for deliberately unmuted playback and hands it back when dismissed (#569: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix the **modmail conversation** layout under iOS 26 Liquid Glass so text no longer bleeds behind the status bar and the tab bar no longer overlaps the compose bar (#543: @icpryde)
- Fix **Hide Bars on Scroll** stuttering on legacy navigation bars before they collapse (#598: @icpryde)
- Fix converted **native menus** on Liquid Glass builds using the old fade animation instead of the iOS 26 glass morph that blooms the menu out of the tapped button (#600: @icpryde)
- Fix **Redgifs posts** on the modern `v3.redgifs.com` host showing a dead link card instead of an inline video player (#568: @icpryde)
- Fix **multi-image Img Chest album posts** producing a dead `imgur.com/a/…` link instead of an Img Chest album, and render the album cover inline in the feed (#554: @icpryde)
- Fix **Show Deleted Comments** freezing the app on heavily-moderated threads, and deleted comment text rendering larger than regular comments (#541: @icpryde)
- Fix an intermittent **crash in Show Deleted Comments** caused by two comment bodies rendering on different threads at once (#563: @nickclyde)
- Fix spurious **"REMOVED BY MOD" chips** on subreddit sidebar stats and on post and comment bylines in subreddits with author flair when Show Deleted Comments was enabled (#516: @icpryde)
- Fix **AI summary cards** rendering as a tall empty gap when reopening a thread by tapping it a second time (#544: @icpryde)
- Fix **comment avatars** intermittently failing to load — transient failures now retry with backoff, and avatars are cached to disk so revisiting a thread needs no re-downloads (#530: @icpryde)
- Fix **Share as Image** pushing the Share button off-screen on small phones when **Include Post Details** was on, and gallery posts showing as a link card instead of the image collage in that mode (#553: @icpryde)
- Fix **subreddit list rows** not showing a tap highlight when **Modern Subreddit Dividers** or **Subreddit List Enhancements** was off (#556: @icpryde)
- Fix the **user flair emoji counter** always showing `/10` instead of the subreddit's real per-template limit (#533: @icpryde)
- Improve the **Show Deleted Comments** enable warning to lead with a plain performance caution instead of implementation details (#565: @icpryde)
- Fix **Theme Manager** display glitches — ambient theming now applies in the Manager and Gallery, the search field no longer inherits the Separators override, SF Mono text is scaled to match other fonts, legacy theme names show proper spacing, and the cell label no longer reverts to "Theme" after navigating back (#580: @jordanearle)
- Fix the **Magnify Info Row loupe** popping when holding the username/subreddit line or starting a scroll near the stats row — activation now hugs the stats row and ignores swipe-like gestures (#586: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **search result rows** staying stuck at full hero height when a link preview resolves to a compact card, leaving the small card atop a large blank gap until you scrolled away and back (#597: @icpryde)
- Fix **Bluesky link-preview cards** whose long title or body text overflowed past the card background in the feed (#577: @icpryde)
- Fix several **API-Key-Free (Web JSON) mode** reliability issues — auth cookies stay current across Reddit's rotations, stale sessions are re-harvested silently, native image uploads and the Submit Post drawer work again, and rate-limit responses are no longer mistaken for session expiry (#562: @nickclyde)

## [v3.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Features

- Add a **Theme Builder** in **Settings > Appearance > Themes** to create, save, and manage multiple custom themes that behave like Apollo's built-in themes, including importing and exporting themes to share them (#454: @jordanearle, @icpryde)
- Add **AI Summaries** in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Apollo AI** (off by default, iOS 26+) — generates post, discussion, and linked-article summaries entirely **on-device** using Apple's FoundationModels (#489, #491: @jordanearle, @icpryde)
  - Post summaries appear in the comments header between the title and body, and discussion summaries appear above the first comment on larger threads; summaries stream in token-by-token and are cached to disk so reopening a thread is instant
  - Includes per-type controls and a **Tap to Summarize** option that avoids auto-fetching a linked article's page until you ask for it
- New experimental **API-Key-Free Mode** in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > API Keys** to use Apollo without API keys by signing in to reddit.com directly! Supports browsing, voting, commenting, and saving. (#442: @nickclyde)
  - In this mode, images attached to comments and posts now upload straight to Reddit's own CDN instead of falling back to Imgur (#495: @nickclyde)
- Add **multi-account credentials** so each signed-in account can use its own Reddit API key (or web session) instead of sharing one, with a redesigned account switcher to add, edit, reorder, and remove accounts, and support for Reddit "Web app" confidential clients (#505: @DeltAndy123)
- Add **Picture-in-Picture** for videos and GIFs — a floating in-app miniplayer that keeps playing as you scroll through the comments (drag to reposition, swipe to hide, double-tap to resize), with optional handoff to the iOS system PiP so playback continues when you leave Apollo (#467: @JeffreyCA)
- Add **Img Chest** as a media upload host in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Media Upload Host** for single images and albums, with thumbnails and host labels in **Manage Uploads**, the ability to delete Img Chest uploads, and an improved album viewer with share, Save All, an accurate loading percentage, and swipe-to-dismiss (#434: @icpryde)
- Revamp the **Subreddit Sidebar** to render new-Reddit's structured content above the existing markdown — community stats (subscribers and created date), a **Search by Flair** chip row that jumps straight to a flair's posts, related communities, resource links, and a table of contents (#462: @icpryde)
- Add an opt-in **Community Highlights** carousel in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Subreddits**, showing a subreddit's pinned posts as tappable cards at the top of the feed, with tap-to-collapse, spoiler blurring, and an optional **Load All Highlights** mode that surfaces the full set of pinned posts (#463, #499: @icpryde)
- Expand **Filters & Blocks** with per-subreddit keyword and post-flair filters plus subreddit-name filtering that hides any subreddit whose name contains a word (e.g. `circlejerk`) across feeds and search (#507: @icpryde)
- Improve **Direct Chat** with inline images, GIFs, and emoji/snoomoji in message bubbles, ImgChest-backed image sending, a recipient avatar in the composer, a **Direct Chat** inbox filter with avatars on every row, and an **Inline Media in Chat** toggle in **Settings > Media** (#488: @icpryde)
- Add **Apple's on-device Translation** (iOS 18+) as a translation provider in **Settings > Translation > Primary Provider**, alongside Google and LibreTranslate (#460: @icpryde)
- Show a user's **Social Links** on their profile page (#465, #496, #498: @icpryde)
- Move **Rich Link Previews** into its own settings section with a combined Body, Comments, and Color sub-screen, and replace the preset card colors with a full color picker (grid, spectrum, sliders, eyedropper, hex) plus quick swatches, a live card preview, and exact full-fill card coloring with automatic text contrast (#504: @icpryde)
- Add **Include Link** and **Share as Video** options to **Share as Image** — attach the post's Reddit link alongside the rendered image, or export the post as a video (#484: @icpryde)
- Add **Inbox Comment Scroll** so tapping a reply in the Inbox lands on the linked comment instead of the top of the post (#457: @icpryde)
- Improve the **user flair selector** to handle old (CSS-class) and emoji-based flair systems, add a custom-emoji picker, and show clearer empty states instead of errors or walls of blank rows (#474: @icpryde)
- Show **moderator avatars** in the subreddit Mods list (#459: @icpryde)
- Add **0.75× and 1.25× playback speeds** to the fullscreen video player (#476: @icpryde)
- Add a **hold-for-2× gesture** — press and hold the right side of a fullscreen video to play at 2× while held, then release to restore the previous speed (#479: @icpryde)

### Fixes

- Replace the misleading **"Error Loading Notifications — contact developer"** alert on free-Apple-ID sideloads with a clear **Notifications Unavailable** explanation, since Apple only grants the push entitlement to paid Developer accounts, so push, watchers, and inbox alerts can never reach those builds; paid-account sideloads and App Store/jailbreak builds are detected and left untouched (#492: @federgilad)
- Make **deleted comment recovery** faster and more reliable, with cleaner labels on recovered comments and a heads-up when enabling it that comments may load slower (#418: @nunoo)
- Fix the tweak's settings screens only following the system light/dark mode instead of **Apollo's own color theme**, along with related cell coloring glitches when switching appearance (#440: @iCrazeiOS)
- Keep a profile's **avatar, banner, bio, and social links** visible even when **Show User Profile Pictures** is turned off (#487: @icpryde)
- Rework the **feed and subreddit search bar** so the navigation bar fully hides on iOS 26 instead of floating half-visible, and add an opt-in **Keep Search Bar In Place** mode in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > General** (#451: @icpryde)
- Fix **link-preview card text** showing raw HTML entities like `&amp;` (#461: @icpryde)
- Fix the **SUBREDDIT SUGGESTIONS** header overlapping the first row on the Search tab (#478: @icpryde)
- Fix the **modern subreddit list** tinting the whole navigation bar when the Home row is selected (#453: @icpryde)
- Fix the **profile-picture tab icon** greying out after opening a direct chat room from the Inbox (#458: @icpryde)
- Fix the **translation globe** spacing in the Liquid Glass navigation bar (#455: @icpryde)
- Fix **Pixel Pals** opening their menu over media, web views, and modals (#506: @icpryde)
- Hide the redundant **GIF** caption beneath inline GIFs (#464: @icpryde)
- Improve the **manual sign-in fallback** UI on older iOS versions (#480: @Alstruit)
- Fix **Hide Mod Subreddits** stripping the moderator badge and mod tools when every moderated subreddit was hidden; the Subreddits list now filters display only, leaving the app-wide moderator roster intact (#500: @icpryde)
- Restore the **follow-thread Live Activity** in the Reborn widgets so a self-hosted notification backend can render and update it again (#490: @nickclyde)
- Show the **website name** on a link card when the scraped title is only numbers, instead of a bare number like a single-page app's match ID (#503: @icpryde)

## [v3.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Features

- New **Apollo Reborn Widgets** — nine Home Screen, Lock Screen, and StandBy widgets (Showerthoughts, Jokes, Post, Feed, Photo, Shortcuts, Apollo Actions, Calendar, and Headline) (#406: @jordanearle)
  - Most widgets read Reddit through your API key: copy a one-time setup code from **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Copy Widget Setup Code** and paste it into any widget, and the rest pick it up automatically
  - Tapping a widget opens the post or subreddit in Apollo; included in the standard build but not the no-extensions variant
- Add a **Universal OAuth Sign-In** toggle in **Settings > Apollo Reborn** (on by default) to fall back to Apollo's native sign-in if the in-app login causes trouble, and ship released IPAs with the `dystopia` and `redreader` sign-in URL schemes already registered so the shared API key works without manually editing Info.plist (#432: @JeffreyCA)
- Add a **manual sign-in fallback** for older iOS versions that can't load Reddit's login page, using an external browser and an Apollo Reborn userscript to paste a sign-in code back into Apollo (#430: @DeltAndy123; sign-in keyboard improvements by @Alstruit)
- Add a **Text Post Thumbnails** toggle in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Media** (on by default) — text posts that embed an image now show a thumbnail with a **Text Post** badge, and tapping it opens the image in the media viewer instead of the thread (#426: @icpryde)
- Add **Hide Mod Subreddits** to remove moderated subreddits you can't leave from the Subreddits list — tap Edit, then the blue button to hide a subreddit and the green button to bring it back (#424: @icpryde)
- Show **moderator reports** as native inline sections in the post and comment action menu (#412: @JeffreyCA)
- Make the **banned-profile overlay** dismissable (#409: @JeffreyCA)
- Combine cache-clearing options into one **Clear Tweak Caches** button under a renamed **Data** section (#409: @JeffreyCA)

### Fixes

- Show the **author avatar and subreddit icon** in **Share as Image** post exports, so the image matches what you see in the app (#438: @icpryde)
- Fix several **link card glitches in feeds** — cards whose text overflowed into the post below, Bluesky posts losing their paragraph breaks, compact cards stuck at full height, and blank image areas on links whose thumbnail isn't ready yet (#427: @icpryde)
- Fix **gallery GIFs** getting stuck on a loading spinner when swiping between items in an album (#404: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix comment and post text showing a literal **`&#x200B;`** or an extra blank line at the end (#405: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **comment scrolling freezing** in threads that contain a link to removed media, such as a deleted `v.redd.it` video (#395: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix spurious **"error :(" overlay** appearing over videos that play fine but whose preview image fails to load (#409: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **Live Activities** not updating on secret-protected self-hosted notification backends (#411: @nickclyde)
- Fix an **installation conflict** when upgrading from some older versions (#401: @Alstruit)
- Bundle **libFLEX inside the app** so rootless jailbreak users can keep the standalone libFLEX package installed without it conflicting with Apollo Reborn (#437: @iCrazeiOS)

## [v3.1.1] - 2026-06-07

- Fix a **crash when sharing a post to Messages or Mail** from the share sheet — the system compose controller was misidentified as an Apollo composer, leaving GIF-toolbar injection timers that dereferenced the dismissed share UI and crashed (#378: @nickclyde)
- Fix **Reddit login on iOS 15** by automatically falling back to Old Reddit, and add an Old Reddit button to the auth view for users who need to switch manually (#377: @DeltAndy123)
- Fix **video controls** overlay rendering, including the AirPlay button getting clipped or misaligned (#383: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **flair alignment** so post and user flairs no longer sit too low or clip their text (#389: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **Color Flairs** reverting to grey or the wrong shade after returning to Apollo from the background (#391: @icpryde)

## [v3.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Features

- Support **any custom redirect URI** for the Reddit API without patching the app's Info.plist, so custom URI schemes authenticate without the "address is invalid" error (also removes the need for LiveContainer users to patch manually) (#368: @DeltAndy123)
- Add **GLASS Icons** and **No Extensions + GLASS Icons** distribution variants that bundle the Liquid Glass icon catalog without opting into the iOS 26 UI runtime (#317: @nackerr)
- Add new **Glitched** (@bajader) and **Modern** / **Modern Alt** (@paulo1manso) Liquid Glass app icons (#353: @bajader, @paulo1manso)
- **Restore logged-in accounts** when restoring a settings backup, so reinstalling no longer requires re-authenticating each Reddit account (#331: @nickclyde)
- Add a **Subreddit List Enhancements** toggle in **Settings > Apollo Reborn Options > Subreddits** to fall back to Apollo's native list, working around misaligned rows and a broken index scrubber on some devices (#355: @JeffreyCA)
- Add a **Color Flairs** option in **Settings > Apollo Reborn Options > General** to color post and user flairs using Reddit's flair colors (#360: @icpryde)
- Add **Show Deleted Comments** to restore deleted or removed comments inline from archived copies when available (#300: @nunoo)
- Render comments with **two or more link previews** as compact cards instead of stacking full hero cards (#344: @icpryde)
- Show **feed thumbnails for text posts** that embed images but produce no native thumbnail, in both Large and Compact modes (#351: @icpryde)
- Fade and disable the comment **image/GIF buttons** when a subreddit doesn't allow that media type, instead of failing only at submit time (#356: @icpryde)
- Add a separate **Autoplay Inline GIFs** setting in **Settings > Apollo Reborn Options > Media** to control inline GIF autoplay independently of Apollo's native Autoplay GIFs/Videos setting (#365: @JeffreyCA)
- Ship an Apollo-Reborn **userscript** and an **"Open in Apollo" Shortcut** recipe as app-independent ways to open Reddit links in Apollo from any browser, handy for the no-extensions variant (#307: @nickclyde)

### Fixes

- Fix the bundled **"Open in Apollo" Safari extension**, which stopped opening links on sideloaded builds — its default "Automatic" mode redirected through `openinapollo.com`, whose auto-open only works for the App Store build. It now redirects straight to `apollo://` and handles `/s/` share links (#307: @nickclyde)
- Fix the bundled **"Open in Apollo" share-sheet action** so it opens Reddit links in Apollo from **any** browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave…), not just Safari, replacing a deprecated call that iOS 18+ refused to run. On iOS 26 the extension only launches if your installer sets the appex main-binary flag — **AltStore/SideStore** do, **Sideloadly/Feather** don't, where the Shortcut remains a signer-independent fallback (#307: @nickclyde)
- Fix **Recently Read** showing no posts after a Reddit API change (#341: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix inline **Reddit GIFs in comments** staying frozen instead of autoplaying until collapsed/expanded or refreshed (#349: @icpryde)
- Fix inline **GIFs not autoplaying on cellular** when Autoplay GIFs/Videos is set to Always (#347: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix the inline **video play button** missing on post-body Reddit videos and a clipped AirPlay icon (#350: @icpryde)
- Fix laggy **subreddit header** scrolling and incorrect handling on non-subreddit feeds (#339: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **Share as Image** not opening under the iOS 26 native action menu (#335: @icpryde)
- Fix the **Rich Link Previews – Body** setting having no effect and following the Comments setting instead (#329: @nickclyde)
- Fix a crash in the banned-profile hook (#326: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix a crash when navigating into comments from a dangling host pointer in inline image cleanup (#362: @JeffreyCA)

## [v3.0.0] - 2026-05-29

### Features

- Post **GIFs in comments**: a new **Gif** button in the compose toolbar opens a built-in Giphy browser (trending + search) and uploads selected GIFs natively to Reddit (#276: @icpryde)
    - Requires a free Giphy API key — set it in **Settings > Custom API > API Keys > Giphy API Key**. See the in-app **Giphy & ImgChest API Key Setup** guide for instructions (#285: @icpryde)
    - Inline playback honors **Settings > General > Autoplay GIFs/Videos** with a static cover + play overlay when paused
- Add **Image Chest** inline album support: bare Image Chest links show the first image inline and open an in-app album viewer with tap-to-hide controls, idle auto-hide, and per-image pinch zoom (#241: @icpryde)
    - To set up Image Chest, create an account at https://imgchest.com, generate an API token at https://imgchest.com/profile/api, and paste it into **Img Chest API Key** under **Settings > Custom API > API Keys**

- Long-press peek now works on usernames and subreddit links in threads and comments (#262: @icpryde)
- Show **banned profile state** with a dead Snoo overlay on user profiles, and surface comment author hints for banned/suspended users (#271, #278: @icpryde, @jordanearle)
- Add **editable user flair text** support to Apollo's flair selector (#255: @nunoo)
- Rich link previews now support translation alongside the rest of post and comment content (#262: @icpryde)
- Subreddit list (Modern mode) polish (#262: @icpryde)
- Add **41 new Liquid Glass icon variants** by @jryng under a new **New Variants** group, plus new **Aperture Science** and **ApollOS** icon sets by @bajader, and reorganize the in-app App Icon picker into groups to reduce clutter (#287, #254: @DeltAndy123, @jryng, @bajader)
- Add **Inline Media Alignment** option in **Settings > Custom API > Media** to left-align, center, or right-align inline images that don't fill the full content width (#273: @lampemw)
- Rename **Custom API** to **Apollo Reborn Options** in Settings, polish the **Thanks To** screen with maintainer/code/icon & design groupings sourced from `contributors.json`, and add an **Apollo Reborn Subreddit** row that opens r/ApolloReborn in-app (#294: @icpryde)
- **Mask API keys** in Custom API settings: Reddit, Reddit Secret, Imgur, Img Chest, and Giphy fields show dots when idle and reveal only while editing (#276: @icpryde)
- Add **Buy Us a Coffee** screen in Settings with maintainer links, and move Apollo's original **Tip Jar** to **Settings > About** above **What's New** (#294: @icpryde)

- General stability improvements around rapid subreddit navigation and image loading (#262, #266: @icpryde, @jordanearle)
- Smoother scrolling through threads with lots of rich link previews (#262: @icpryde)
- Keep user profile cards and peek previews up to date when an account is suspended or banned (#278: @jordanearle, @icpryde)
- Fix launch crash when opening a banned user's profile (#276: @icpryde)
- Fix crash on Reddit link previews in some comment threads (#276, #280: @JeffreyCA, @icpryde)
- Fix Reddit-hosted GIFs stopping animation after leaving and returning to a thread (#276: @icpryde)
- Fix Giphy GIFs posted from Apollo not rendering in the official Reddit iOS app (and showing a "image was probably deleted" placeholder when editing in Apollo) (#289: @icpryde)
- Fix Compact link preview cards growing to hero size and overlapping the next comment after voting on a comment that contains a link (#290: @icpryde)

## [v2.14.0] - 2026-05-20

### Features

- **Notification Backend** support (requires paid Apple Developer account): point Apollo at your own forked self-hosted [apollo-backend](https://github.com/nickclyde/apollo-backend) instance so push registrations, watchers, and inbox checks route there instead of being silently dropped. (Thanks @nickclyde!)
    - Configure in **Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend** with the backend URL and optional registration token. Leave empty to keep current blocking behavior.
    - APNs delivery still requires a paid Apple Developer account on the signing side. 
- New **Reddit API Secret** field in **Settings > Custom API > API Keys** so per-account Reddit credentials can be forwarded to a self-hosted notification backend that performs token refreshes server-side. Usually left empty for installed-app Reddit credentials. (Thanks @nickclyde!)

- Refine Liquid Glass **Hide Bars on Scroll** idle behavior with smoother re-collapse/re-expand handling and disable the idle setting on unsupported iOS versions.

- Liquid Glass: new **Tab Bar Re-Expands When Idle** toggle in **Settings > Custom API > General** that re-expands the tab bar after a deliberate upward scroll or a longer idle timeout (thanks @icpryde!)
- New **Thanks To** screen under **About** section. Thank you to all the contributors who've helped make this tweak what it is ❤️

### Fixes

- Fix Reddit-hosted multi-image photo posts by submitting them as native Reddit galleries instead of Imgur albums, including the post-submit comments permalink Apollo opens after success (thanks @icpryde!)
- Fix the Photo Post composer thumbnail strip so all selected images can be reviewed with reliable horizontal scrolling before submit (thanks @icpryde!)
- Improve user avatar loading on multireddits

## [v2.11.0] - 2026-05-15

🎉 ***Massive*** update that enables Ultra features like saved categories, new app icons and Pixel Pals! This also brings new features like recently read posts and fixes for some longstanding Apollo bugs.

The Custom API settings view has also been redesigned and is now accessible directly from Settings.

**Note:** Ultra features that rely on push notifications do not work out of the box. Advanced users can optionally point the tweak at a self-hosted [apollo-backend](https://github.com/nickclyde/apollo-backend) fork (see **Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend**) — APNs delivery requires a paid Apple Developer account on the signing side.

- Fix certain Streamable links not loading in media view

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-01-10

- Support custom redirect URI and user agent (in Settings > General > Custom API)
- Liquid Glass: fix sort options alignment in comment view

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-01-07

- Fix crashes in Custom API settings on older iOS versions

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-01-03

## [v1.3.0] - 2025-12-28

- Backup and restore most Apollo and tweak settings (in Settings > General > Custom API)
    - Settings are exported as a .zip file with 2 plist files: preferences.plist (most Apollo and tweak settings) and group.plist (filters, theme settings)
    - Restoring settings **does not** restore or affect existing account logins. This means on a clean install, accounts need to be re-added manually. The backup .zip contains an accounts.txt with all account usernames for reference.
- Update Custom API Settings layout

## [v1.2.6] - 2025-11-08

- Fix video downloads failing on certain v.redd.it videos
    - Recently, Reddit started using [CMAF media format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/about-the-common-media-application-format-with-http-live-streaming-hls) for serving video content, which Apollo does not natively support downloading for.

## [v1.2.5] - 2025-10-18

- Fix occassional crashes when scrolling on iOS 26 with Liquid Glass patch (thanks @dankrichtofen for the original implementation)
- Fix crashes when tapping share URL link buttons on iOS 26
    - Note that this is **not** a full fix. Tapping the link button now navigates to a webview on iOS 26. As a workaround, tap the inline text (see [comment here](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/62#issuecomment-3247359652)).

- Update Custom API settings with link to [new GitHub discussion](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/discussions/60) where you can share your own subreddit sources with others.

## [v1.2.2] - 2025-01-16

- Fix video downloads failing on certain v.redd.it videos
    - Note that the `.deb` file is significantly larger (several MB) because of new external dependencies needed to fix the issue (FFmpegKit)

## [v1.2.1] - 2024-12-19

- Custom random and trending subreddits - you can now specify an external URL to use as the source for random and trending subreddits (in Settings > General > Custom API)
    - Sources should be a plaintext file with one subreddit name per line, without the `/r/` prefix (see examples below)
    - Default trending source (data from [gummysearch.com](https://gummysearch.com/tools/top-subreddits/)): https://jeffreyca.github.io/subreddits/trending-gummy-daily.txt
    - Default /r/random source: https://jeffreyca.github.io/subreddits/popular.txt
    - New setting to customize how many trending subreddits to show

## [v1.1.7] - 2024-10-19

- Improve parsing `new.reddit.com` and `np.reddit.com` links

## [v1.1.6] - 2024-10-05

- Fix crashing issue when loading content

## [v1.1.3] - 2024-08-23

Fix issue with newer Imgur images and albums not loading properly

## [v1.1.2] - 2024-08-01

Update user agent to fix multireddit search

## [v1.1.1] - 2024-07-27

- Working hybrid implementation of "New Comments Highlighter" Ultra feature
- Add FLEX integration for debugging/tweaking purposes (requires app restart after enabling in Settings -> General -> Custom API)

## [v1.0.12] - 2024-07-25

Use generic user agent independent of bundle ID when sending requests to Reddit

## [v1.0.11] - 2024-02-27

Fix issue with Imgur uploads consistently failing. Note that multi-image uploads may still fail on the first attempt.

## [v1.0.10] - 2024-01-22

Add support for /u/ share links (e.g. `reddit.com/u/username/s/xxxxxx`).

## [v1.0.9] - 2023-12-29

- Randomize "trending subreddits list" so it doesn't show **iOS**, **Clock**, **Time**, **IfYouDontMind** all the time - thanks [@iCrazeiOS](https://github.com/iCrazeiOS)!
    - Context: There isn't an official Reddit API to get the currently trending subreddits. Apollo has a hardcoded mapping of dates to trending subreddits in this file called `trending-subreddits.plist` that is bundled inside the .ipa. The last date entry is `2023-9-9`, which is why Apollo has been falling back to the default **iOS**, **Clock**, **Time**, **IfYouDontMind** subreddits lately.

## [v1.0.8] - 2023-12-15

- Lower minimum iOS version requirement to 14.0
- Toggleable settings for blocking announcements and some Ultra settings (not fully working, see [#1](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/1)). **These are the same as the previous experimental builds.**
    - All toggles are located in Settings -> General -> Custom API
    - New Comments Highlightifier shows new comment count badge, but doesn't highlight comments inside a thread
    - Subreddit Weather and Time widget doesn't seem to work (not showing or loads infinitely)

## [v1.0.7] - 2023-12-07

- Add support for resolving Reddit media share links ([#9](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/pull/9)) - thanks [@mmshivesh](https://github.com/mmshivesh)!

## [v1.0.5] - 2023-12-02

- Fix crash when tapping on spoiler tag

## [v1.0.4] - 2023-11-29

Add support for share links (e.g. `reddit.com/r/subreddit/s/xxxxxx`) in Apollo. These links are obfuscated and require loading them in the background to resolve them to the standard Reddit link format that can be understood by 3rd party apps.

The tweak uses the workaround and further optimizes it by pre-resolving and caching share links in the background for a smoother user experience. You may still see the occassional (brief) loading alert when tapping a share link while it resolves in the background.

There are currently a few limitations:
- Share links in private messages still open in the in-app browser
- Long-tapping share links still pop open a browser page

## [v1.0.3b] - 2023-11-26
- Treat `x.com` links as Twitter links so they can be opened in Twitter app
- Fix issue with `apollogur.download` network requests not getting blocked properly (#3)

## [v1.0.2c] - 2023-11-08
- Fix Imgur multi-image uploads (first attempt usually fails but subsequent retries should succeed)

## [v1.0.1] - 2023-10-18
- Suppress wallpaper popup entirely

## [v1.0.0] - 2023-10-13
- Initial release
