# iPad Pane Layout — Engineering Plan

## Current implementation — 7 September 2026

The original proposal below is retained as historical RE/design context. Current
source implements **two content columns per tab**, inside Apollo's existing
five-destination tab/sidebar controller. The system sidebar is a destination
surface, not a third content navigation stack. Production eligibility is opt-in
on iPadOS 18+, while the device tweak's deployment floor remains iOS 14.

Primary selection replaces the detail root; navigation started in detail pushes
within detail. Compact root Back uses a reversible native interactive transition;
UIKit column wrappers are structural containment, never application routes.
Scene-owned registration and native URL entry restore the exact originating tab
hierarchy. Required runtime capabilities are checked before installation.

The primary feed uses Apollo's compact native nodes by default, with a pane-local
Comfortable option. `ApolloPaneChrome` owns native search/title policy. Comments
Find uses one system `UIFindInteraction` adapter over Apollo's matcher; the old
extra Find toolbar is suppressed. Context geometry follows actual native bars and
the tab content guide, not a fixed 54-point constant. Text constraints and additive
Settings insets are separate from full-width media layout.

Host geometry, scheduling, settlement, chrome, content, focus, sidebar and tracing
now live in separate `src/ipad/ApolloPane*` modules. No display link runs
continuously for idle panes, and live divider samples update only the visible tab.
The adaptive-phone switch is simulator-only and retains the phone idiom; it is
preparation for resizable phones, not certified foldable support.

See [Plan 002](../plans/002-ipad-pane-redesign.md) and
[implementation results](../plans/003-ipad-pane-implementation-results.md) for the
current specification and evidence. Physical-device performance/accessibility/OS
gates remain open; the experiment must not be promoted from simulator results.

## Historical proposal and reverse-engineering notes

Branch: `je/ipad-pane-layout` (experimental, off `main`)

Tracking issues: [#225](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/225) (iPad support),
[#635](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/635) (tab bar over search bar),
[#782](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/782) (jump bar hover jank),
[#387](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/387) (floating menu placement — closed, stopgap shipped as #557).

> This is the largest UI change the tweak has attempted. The plan is deliberately
> staged so that every phase is independently shippable and independently
> revertable, and so that the riskiest assumption is tested before any
> architecture is committed to.

## 1. What we are building

A three-column, opt-in iPad layout:

```
┌────────────┬───────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
│  SIDEBAR   │   POST LIST       │   COMMENTS / DETAIL  │
│            │                   │                      │
│ ◉ Home     │ r/apple      ⌄ ⋯  │  ← Post title        │
│ ○ Search   │ ───────────────── │  ══════════════════  │
│ ○ Profile  │ ▸ Post one        │  [ media / body ]    │
│ ○ Inbox    │ ▸ Post two        │                      │
│ ○ Settings │ ▸ Post three      │  ┌ u/abc   ▲ 42      │
│ ────────── │ ▸ Post four       │  │ comment text…     │
│ ⭐ Home    │ ▸ Post five       │  │ ┌ u/def  ▲ 12     │
│ 🔥 Popular │ ▸ Post six        │  │ │ reply text…     │
│ 🌐 All     │ ▸ Post seven      │  └ u/ghi   ▲ 3       │
│ ────────── │ ▸ Post eight      │                      │
│ r/apple    │ ▸ Post nine       │  ┌ u/jkl   ▲ 8       │
│ r/ios      │ ▸ Post ten        │  │ comment text…     │
└────────────┴───────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

Non-goals for this branch: a bespoke iPad *visual* design language, a Mac
Catalyst build, or reimplementing any Apollo screen. Every column hosts a real
Apollo view controller.

### Design principles

1. **Opt-in and reversible.** Default OFF, iPad-only, iPhone code paths never
   execute the new code. A user who never enables it must not be able to tell
   this shipped.
2. **Reuse Apollo's real view controllers.** We re-host, never reimplement. The
   subreddit list keeps its section index, edit mode, multireddits and
   drag-reorder because it *is* `RedditListViewController`.
3. **Compact width must equal today's app.** `UISplitViewController` collapse
   already folds a triple-column layout into a single navigation stack —
   sidebar → list → detail — which is exactly today's push hierarchy. The
   fallback is free and correct, and it covers Slide Over, small Stage Manager
   windows, and portrait on smaller iPads.
4. **Allowlist routing, never blocklist.** Only view controller classes we have
   explicitly classified get routed to a different column. Everything else
   pushes in place, i.e. behaves exactly as it does today. Apollo has ~90 view
   controllers and the tweak adds its own; an allowlist is the only safe default.
5. **`ApolloTabBarController` keeps its identity and index space.** It stays the
   window's root view controller with the same five children in the same order.
   This is what keeps deep links, quick actions, the settings router, the crash
   prompt coordinator and `ApolloMainTabBarController()` working.

---

## 2. Ground truth (verified, not assumed)

Everything in this section was confirmed against the shipping binary,
`Apollo.app/Info.plist`, or the existing tweak source.

### App capabilities

| Fact | Value | Source | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UIDeviceFamily` | `[1, 2]` | `Apollo.app/Info.plist` | Apollo is already a native iPad app, not in compatibility mode. |
| `UIRequiresFullScreen` | absent | `Apollo.app/Info.plist` | Multitasking is already on, so Apollo **already survives compact width on iPad today**. The compact fallback is proven code, not new risk. |
| `UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes` | `true` | `Apollo.app/Info.plist` | Stage Manager / multi-window is available for free later. |
| `MinimumOSVersion` | `15.0` | `Apollo.app/Info.plist` | The real floor is iOS 15, not the tweak's 14.0 target. |

### Container hierarchy

Recovered from `-[SceneDelegate scene:willConnectToSession:options:]`
(`sub_1000879c0`) and the tab bar factory (`sub_100087244`):

- `sub_100087244()` builds `ApolloTabBarController` and sets exactly **five**
  `ApolloNavigationController` children.
- The scene delegate then does `[window setRootViewController:tabBarController]`,
  stores it in its own `tabBarController` ivar, and calls `makeKeyAndVisible`.
- **Consequence:** hooking `scene:willConnectToSession:options:` and
  post-processing after `%orig` is a clean install point. The scene delegate's
  `tabBarController` ivar still points at the real tab bar controller, so
  `ApolloMainTabBarController()` keeps working untouched.
- Tab index 2 is Profile (`-[ApolloTabBarController goToProfileTab]` →
  `setSelectedIndex:2`), matching `ApolloProfileTabIndex` in `ApolloUserAvatars.xm`.
- Tab 0's root is `RedditListViewController` — asserted with `isMemberOfClass:`
  by `ApolloQuickActions.xm`.
- Tab 0 can launch with a **two-deep** stack (subreddit list + a restored
  `PostsViewController`). That restore state maps one-to-one onto
  sidebar + list columns, which is a useful signal that the split is natural.
- The factory calls `loadViewIfNeeded` and `waitUntilAllUpdatesAreProcessed` on
  several roots — Apollo pre-warms these synchronously at launch, so any
  restructuring must happen *after* `%orig` returns.

### Push pipeline internals (`sub_10015c720`)

`-[ApolloNavigationController pushViewController:animated:]` is a thin ObjC shim
over one Swift body, `sub_10015c720`. Decompiled, it:

1. **Silently drops duplicate pushes** — if the incoming VC is already in
   `viewControllers`, the whole body no-ops. A router that moves a VC between
   columns must remove it from the source stack first, or later Apollo-side
   pushes of that same instance will silently do nothing.
2. Sets `extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars = YES` on every pushed VC before
   calling super.
3. Sets the `pushing` ivar, which the custom `ApolloNavigationAnimator` and the
   interactive-pop machinery read.
4. If the nav bar is hidden and the `HideBarsOnScroll` default is set, it
   schedules ~100 escalating `asyncAfter` re-layout attempts on the main queue.
   With hide-bars active in three columns, these timer storms run per column.

**Consequence for the router:** reroute by *calling the destination column's
navigation controller's normal `pushViewController:`*, never by splicing
`viewControllers` arrays. That way Apollo's own body runs on the destination —
dedupe, extended-layout, `pushing` flag, nav-bar re-show — and every per-nav
invariant stays coherent. (This is also why the ObjC-level hook is the right
interception point: Logos hooks the shim, so a reroute can return without ever
running Apollo's Swift body on the wrong nav.)

### Forward stack: `poppedViewControllers` + `goForward`

Confirmed by decompiling `-[ApolloNavigationController goForward]`: every pop
appends to a per-nav `poppedViewControllers` array, and `goForward` re-pushes
its tail through the same push body. This powers keyboard "go forward" **and the
right-screen-edge pan gesture**. Two consequences:

- **Per-column forward stacks.** If the router clears the secondary column when
  a new list loads, those cleared VCs land in that column's forward stack.
  Policy needed: clear the forward stack on cross-column reroutes (recommended —
  a "forward" that re-pushes a comments VC for a post no longer in the list
  column is disorienting), or accept per-column forward history.
- **The gesture conflict is now concrete, not hypothetical** (see §5.4): Apollo
  installs pans on *both* edges of every nav controller, so every interior
  column boundary in a triple-column layout has an Apollo recognizer on each
  side of it, plus UIKit's own split-view show/hide gesture.

### Width-change handling — what Apollo actually does

Searched the full procedure list: **no** `viewWillTransitionToSize:` and **no**
`traitCollectionDidChange:` overrides exist on `ASTableViewController`,
`PostsViewController`, or `CommentsViewController`. (Only
`ApolloNavigationController` and `MediaViewerController` implement the former.)
All width adaptation in the content controllers is passive:
`viewDidLayoutSubviews` re-frames overlays (dark overlay, jump-bar dropdown —
both computed from `view.bounds` with a max-width clamp and centering, so they
are already column-relative), and the actual cell re-measure is Texture
framework behavior — `ASTableView.layoutSubviews` re-measures every node when
its constrained width changes (`AsyncDisplayKit.framework` is embedded in
`Apollo.app/Frameworks/`).

Two readings of this:

- **Good:** there is no custom rotation/resize code in the content controllers
  to fight. Resize correctness comes for free from Texture.
- **Correction to an earlier claim:** the `restoredViewWidth` ivars on
  Posts/Comments/Inbox are **state-restoration** bookkeeping (scale the saved
  scroll offset when the restored width differs), *not* live-resize support.
  They are evidence Apollo tolerates width differences across launches, not
  evidence the live re-measure is cheap. The entire live-resize cost is
  Texture's full re-measure, there is no incremental path, and Phase 0's
  measurement of it is *the* number this project hangs on.

### Custom presentation controllers are window-anchored

Apollo ships ~20 custom `UIPresentationController` subclasses (ActionController,
SubredditSelector, Sourdough, FlairAlert, TipJar, AccountManager, …).
Decompiled `ActionControllerPresentationController
frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView`: it sizes from **`containerView.bounds`**
(the window in a standard presentation) with a max-width clamp (`fminnm`) and
`(containerWidth − width) / 2` centering. So in the pane layout, action menus
and card sheets present **centered over the whole window**, not over the source
column. Not a crash risk — the max-width clamp means they don't stretch — but a
UX note: long-press menus on a post in the list column appear window-centered.
Acceptable for v1; column-anchored presentation would mean re-parenting Apollo's
presentation controllers and is explicitly out of scope.

Related standard-iPad requirement for tweak-drawn UI: `UIActivityViewController`
and alert-sheet presentations on iPad require a popover `sourceView`/`sourceRect`
or they throw. Apollo handles its own; every *tweak* share-sheet call site that
becomes reachable from a new column context needs a popover source audit.

### UIKit API availability

| API | Introduced | Usable here? |
|---|---|---|
| `UISplitViewController(style: .tripleColumn)` | iOS 14 | **Yes** — this is the backbone. Covers the whole iOS 15+ floor. |
| `UITabBarController.mode` / `.sidebar` | **iOS 18** | Optional enhancement only. Cannot be the backbone. |
| `UITab` / `UITabGroup` / `UISearchTab` | **iOS 18** | Not used — see below. |

**Why not build on `mode = .tabSidebar`.** It renders a sidebar from static
`UITab`/`UITabGroup` objects. Apollo's sidebar content is the *subreddit list*:
dynamic, sectioned, editable, reorderable, with multireddits and a section index.
Expressing that as `UITab` objects would mean reimplementing subscription
management, which violates principle 2 and would regress behavior users rely on.
It is also iOS 18+, so it could never be the only path. We may offer it later as
a cosmetic variant for the destinations rail specifically.

---

## 3. Architecture

### Topology

The app has exactly **one** persistent navigation surface, and it belongs to the
tab bar controller rather than to any tab. `UITabBarController.mode =
.tabSidebar` turns the floating tab bar into UIKit's own sidebar; each tab then
contributes only a list and a detail column.

```
UIWindow.rootViewController
└── ApolloTabBarController                    ← unchanged object
    │   mode = .tabSidebar                    ← UIKit draws the sidebar: FIXED, identical on every tab
    ├── tab 0  ApolloPaneSplitViewController  (.doubleColumn)
    │            ├─ .primary    ApolloNavigationController  ← the tab's OWN stack, verbatim
    │            │                (RedditListViewController → PostsViewController → …)
    │            └─ .secondary  ApolloNavigationController  ← detail stack (CommentsViewController…)
    ├── tab 1  ApolloPaneSplitViewController  (Inbox:    thread list → message)
    ├── tab 2  ApolloPaneSplitViewController  (Profile:  sections   → detail)
    ├── tab 3  ApolloPaneSplitViewController  (Search:   results    → post)
    └── tab 4  ApolloPaneSplitViewController  (Settings: sections   → detail)
```

Which reads on screen as three stable regions:

```
[ sidebar: destinations ] [ list ]              [ detail ]
   UIKit, never changes     the tab's own stack   comment thread
```

**Why the sidebar is UIKit's and not ours.** `mode = .tabSidebar` brings the
platform's own selection, hover, drag-and-drop and keyboard behavior, a system
toggle back to the floating tab bar, and — critically — automatic adaptation:
in portrait UIKit collapses the sidebar back into a floating tab bar with a
reveal button, so the destinations are never unreachable. A hand-drawn rail in a
split view column could not do that (see §6a, which is why it was blocked).

**Verified, and worth recording because the documentation does not say so:**
this works with tabs that came from the **legacy `viewControllers` array**.
Apollo never adopted the iOS 18 `tabs`/`UITab` API — it assigns five navigation
controllers the old way — and UIKit still synthesizes the tab model and renders a
full sidebar from them. Confirmed on an iPad Pro 13" simulator: mode resolved to
2, a live `UITabBarControllerSidebar`, `hidden=0`, all five destinations with
their titles, icons and the inbox badge. Had it required `tabs`, the alternative
would have been rebuilding Apollo's tab model by hand.

**Why every pane is two columns.** With destinations in the sidebar, a third
column would be a *fourth* region on screen. The Home tab briefly had one — a
subreddit-list column — and the result was four columns plus a floating tab bar
plus our own sidebar-toggle button: three navigation surfaces competing at once,
and a left pane whose contents changed identity per tab. It also duplicated
Apollo's existing "Home ⌄" title menu, which already switches subreddits. The
tab's navigation controller now goes into the list column verbatim, so the
subreddit list pushes to a feed *inside that one column* exactly as on iPhone.

**Why per-tab split views rather than one global one.** Each tab keeps its own
column state, so leaving Inbox and coming back restores the post you were
reading. It also means the tab bar controller's children array is the only thing
that changes shape, which keeps the audit surface to one list of call sites (§5).

**No `.compact` column is set.** `UISplitViewController` collapses a double
column by pushing the secondary onto the primary's navigation controller, which
reproduces today's push hierarchy exactly. Setting an explicit compact controller
would mean maintaining a second layout by hand.

**Panes must set `extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars`.** Recovered from UIKit's
`-[UITabBarController _frameForViewController:]`: the tab bar's height is
subtracted from a child's frame unless the tab bar is hidden, the child extends
under the bottom edge, or — for an *opaque* tab bar, which Apollo's is — the
child sets `extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars`. Apollo sets that flag on
everything it pushes, so its stock screens run full height. A pane is a
controller we construct, so it never inherited the flag and UIKit reserved room
for a tab bar that sidebar mode had already taken off screen — a dead 64pt strip
along the bottom of every column. Confirmed both ways: the stock hierarchy gives
the tab child the full 1032pt, and the pane went 968 → 1032 once the flag was set.

### Column routing

A single interception point classifies pushes and redirects them.

`ApolloSwipeUpComments.xm` already proves this technique in this codebase: it
hooks `-[UINavigationController pushViewController:animated:]`, recognizes
`_TtC6Apollo22CommentsViewController`, intercepts it before it lands, and
re-presents it somewhere else. The pane router is the same mechanism with a
class table instead of a single class.

With two columns the table gets much shorter than the three-column draft needed:
anything list-shaped simply stays in the list column, which is where Apollo was
already pushing it. Only genuinely detail-shaped screens are redirected.

| Class | Column | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CommentsViewController` | secondary | The headline case, and the only class routed across columns today. |
| `PostsViewController`, `LitePostsViewController` | list (in place) | Listed only so that opening a new feed **clears** a stale thread from the detail column. |
| **everything else** | **push in place** | Default. Subreddit drill-ins, settings sub-screens, composers, media viewers, web views, and every tweak-owned VC keep today's behavior until explicitly classified. |

Candidates deliberately **not** yet added, because each needs its own testing
pass and an untested entry is worse than an unrouted one:
`PrivateMessageViewController` / `MessagesViewController` (secondary),
`ProfileViewController` when pushed from an author (secondary),
`SubredditSidebarViewController` / `SubredditRulesViewController` (secondary).

Note the comment *list* controllers — `AllSubredditCommentsViewController`,
`SavedPostsCommentsViewController`, `UserCommentsViewController` — must stay in
place despite their names. They are feeds whose rows open a real
`CommentsViewController`, which routes to the detail column on its own.

Rules:
- Pushing a list-class VC clears the secondary column to its placeholder.
- Pushing a detail-class VC **replaces** the secondary stack rather than
  appending, unless it was pushed *from within* the secondary column (e.g.
  tapping a link inside comments), in which case it appends.
- Modal presentations are never rerouted.

### Where the code lives

New directory `src/ipad/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ApolloPaneLayout.{h,m}` | Feature gate, capability check, change notification, the `sPaneLayoutEnabled` state read. Single source of truth for "are panes active right now". |
| `ApolloPaneInstall.xm` | Hooks `-[SceneDelegate scene:willConnectToSession:options:]`; builds/tears down the split controllers after `%orig`. |
| `ApolloPaneSplitViewController.{h,m}` | `UISplitViewController` subclass + delegate: collapse/expand behavior, column widths, placeholder detail VC, safe-area column host, theming. |
| ~~`ApolloPaneSidebarViewController.{h,m}`~~ | **Not needed.** UIKit's tab sidebar replaced the hand-drawn rail entirely. |
| `ApolloPaneRouter.xm` | The push interception and column classification table. |
| `ApolloPaneChrome.xm` | Per-column nav bar / immersive header / scroll-edge reconciliation (§5.3). |

### Settings gate

Follows the existing `IPadTabBarBottom` pattern end to end:

- `UserDefaultConstants.h`: `UDKeyIPadPaneLayout` + `ApolloIPadPaneLayoutChangedNotification`
- `ApolloState.{h,m}`: `extern BOOL sIPadPaneLayout;` default `NO`
- `Tweak.xm`: `registerDefaults` entry + `%ctor` read
- `settings/CustomAPIViewController.m`: an iPad-only row under General, hidden
  entirely on iPhone (same `userInterfaceIdiom` guard as the existing row).

Because installation happens at scene connect, toggling requires a relaunch.
Present it as an explicit "Requires restart" row with a confirm-and-restart
action rather than pretending it applies live. When panes are ON, the existing
"Move Tab Bar to Bottom" row is hidden — it is meaningless without the floating
pill.

---

## 4. Phases

Each phase is independently shippable and independently revertable.

### Phase 0 — Spike (throwaway code, do not merge)

Purpose: falsify the riskiest assumptions before committing to architecture.
Force panes on for the Home tab only, hardcoded, no settings, no polish.

Inner loop:
```bash
SIM_DEVICE_TYPE="iPad Pro 13-inch (M5)" scripts/run-in-sim.sh --glass --dark
```
(iPad simulators are present; `run-in-sim.sh` already parameterizes the device
type, so no script changes are needed to start.)

Exit criteria — all must hold before Phase 1 begins:

1. `RedditListViewController` renders and behaves in a ~320pt primary column:
   section index titles, edit mode, swipe actions, multireddits.
2. `PostsViewController` (an `ASTableNode`) re-measures correctly when its column
   width changes, including a Stage Manager drag-resize, without visible cell
   corruption.
3. `CommentsViewController` renders in the secondary column with correct comment
   indentation at reduced width.
4. Collapse to compact (Slide Over) and re-expand does not lose the navigation
   stack or crash.
5. Frame rate during a continuous Stage Manager resize is acceptable, and memory
   with three live columns is measured and recorded.

If (2) or (5) fail, stop and reassess: ASDK re-measure cost under continuous
resize is the assumption most likely to sink this design, and it is cheaper to
learn now.

> **Status (branch `je/ipad-pane-layout`).** Phases 1 and 2 are built. Phase 0's
> spike was folded into Phase 1 rather than thrown away — the container work was
> the same either way, so the exit criteria are being answered against real code.
>
> **Working today**, verified on an iPad Pro 13" simulator with a signed-in
> account: the Home tab runs three columns (subreddits → feed → comments), the
> other four run two, tapping a post opens its thread beside the feed, and a
> sidebar toggle reaches the subreddit list in portrait. The floating tab bar is
> still present — the destinations rail that would replace it is not built.
>
> Phase 0 exit criteria:
> | # | Criterion | Status |
> |---|---|---|
> | 1 | Subreddit list behaves in a narrow column | **Pass** — favorites, multireddits, moderator sections, A–Z index, Edit all intact |
> | 2 | Feed re-measures on width change | **Partially** — correct at each discrete width; the continuous drag-resize case is untested |
> | 3 | Comments render at reduced width | **Pass** — after the column-host fix (§5.2a) |
> | 4 | Collapse/expand keeps the stack | **Pass** — both cases, via the `compact on\|off` sim command |
> | 5 | Resize frame rate + three-column memory measured | **Not done** |
>
> Criterion 4 is now testable without Slide Over: `echo "compact on" >
> /tmp/apollofix-tap.txt` (see `ApolloSimDebugTap.xm`) forces a compact
> horizontal size class onto every pane, which is exactly what makes a split view
> collapse. Verified in both directions — a pane with a thread open collapses
> onto the secondary column and comes back intact, and a pane with an empty
> detail collapses onto the primary without dragging its placeholder along.
>
> Criteria 2 and 5 still need a real device or a driven window resize, which the
> simulator inner loop cannot produce. **They remain the outstanding risk**, and
> §5.2 is still the assumption this design hangs on.
>
> Also verified: iPhone is completely untouched with the layout code compiled in
> — zero pane log lines across a full launch and a normal single-column UI.

### Phase 1 — Foundation (no visible change)

- Settings key, state, gate, iPad-only row, relaunch flow.
- `ApolloPaneLayout` capability check.
- Install/uninstall of split controllers at scene connect.
- **The hierarchy-assumption audit (§5.1)** — the ~15 call sites, routed through
  one shared helper.
- Routing table present but empty: *every* push still lands in place.

Ship state: with the toggle on, the app looks essentially like today (single
wide column) but is structurally split. This isolates "did the container change
break anything" from "did the routing break anything", which is the single most
valuable thing this phase buys.

### Phase 2 — Home tab — **done**

Tab sidebar on, Home running list + detail, placeholder detail state, selection
persistence when switching tabs. Verified on an iPad Pro 13" simulator:
sidebar 270pt, list column 280–760, detail 760–1376, tapping a post routes
`CommentsViewController` to the detail column, collapse/expand preserves the
open thread and its scroll position, and portrait falls back to UIKit's floating
tab bar with a sidebar reveal button.

### Phase 3 — Remaining tabs — **structurally done, routing not extended**

All five tabs are panes and all five lay out correctly; switching tabs leaves
the sidebar untouched and replaces only the content. What is *not* done is
extending the routing table beyond `CommentsViewController` — Inbox messages,
author profiles and subreddit sidebars still push in place rather than opening
in the detail column (see §3, "candidates deliberately not yet added"). Inbox
and Modmail carry their own selector and compose flows and should be last.

### Phase 4 — iPad-native polish

This is what stops it feeling like a stretched iPhone app, and much of it is
cheap because Apollo already implements the hard part:

- **Keyboard.** `ApolloNavigationController` already exposes `keyCommands` for
  `selectNextCell`, `goIntoCell`, `goBack`, `pageUp`, `scrollToTop`,
  `goToJumpBar`, `openMedia`. With panes these become genuinely desktop-class —
  they just need to target the focused column via the responder chain.
- **Pointer.** Hover states on rows and the jump bar. Fixes
  [#782](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/782), whose hover
  handling currently drops the Liquid Glass effect and clips the title.
- **Context menus and drag & drop.** Drag a subreddit onto the list column; drag
  a post into a new window.
- **Multi-window.** `UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes` is already true — "open
  post in new window" is largely plumbing.

### Phase 5 — Adaptivity hardening + regression sweep

Slide Over, all Stage Manager sizes, both rotations, iPad multitasking splits,
and a full iPhone regression pass to prove the dormant path is really dormant.

---

## 5. Known costs and risks

### 5.1 Hierarchy assumptions (bounded, mechanical)

Roughly 15 call sites assume `tabBarController.viewControllers[i]` is a
`UINavigationController`. Confirmed in: `ApolloDirectChatWeb.xm` (several),
`ApolloUserAvatars.xm`, `ApolloQuickActions.xm`, `ApolloLiquidGlass.xm`,
`Tweak.xm`, `ApolloAutoHideTabBar.xm`, `ApolloAutoHideMetaFeeds.xm`,
`ApolloImageUploadHost.xm`, `ApolloSwipeUpComments.xm`,
`ApolloBadgeBookViewController.m`, `UIWindow+Apollo.m`, `ApolloPictureInPicture.xm`.

Fix: add one helper to `ApolloCommon` that unwraps a tab child to its active
navigation controller (identity today, split-view-aware when panes are on), and
route every site through it. Mechanical, enumerable, and testable on iPhone
where it must be a no-op.

### 5.2 ASDK re-measure under column resize — **highest risk**

Apollo's feed and comments are `ASTableNode`-backed; cells measure against a
constrained width. Column resize means Texture re-measures **every node** in the
table (`ASTableView.layoutSubviews` on constrained-width change — framework
behavior, no incremental path). The binary confirms there is no custom resize
handling to help or hinder: no `viewWillTransitionToSize:` or
`traitCollectionDidChange:` on any content controller (§2). The
`restoredViewWidth` ivars are state-restoration offset-scaling, not live-resize
support — the app tolerating width *differences across launches* is weaker
evidence than previously stated. What does still count in our favor: Apollo runs
resizable on iPad today, so single-column live resize (Slide Over, Split View)
already exercises this path in production. What's new in the pane layout is
*three* live node graphs re-measuring on one drag — which interacts badly with
the memory pressure recorded in the August 2026 OOM wave. Phase 0 exists to put
a number on exactly this.

One cheap mitigation if the spike shows churn: `UISplitViewController` column
resizes step through discrete widths (display-mode changes) far more often than
they animate continuously — continuous re-measure mainly bites during Stage
Manager window drags, where a debounce (re-measure on drag end, letterbox during)
is an accepted pattern.

### 5.2a iPadOS 26 floats the sidebar over a FULL-WIDTH secondary — **confirmed, and it bites Texture immediately**

Found while building Phase 1, from a live hierarchy dump on an iPad Pro 13":

```
secondary  _UISplitViewControllerAdaptiveColumnView  (0, 0, 1032, 1312)   ← full window
primary    _UISplitViewControllerAdaptiveColumnView  (10, 86,  413, 1216) ← inset glass panel
```

The secondary column is laid out at the **full window width** and the sidebar
floats over it as a Liquid Glass panel. This is the iPadOS 26 design, not a
misconfiguration — `preferredSplitBehavior = .tile` does not change it.

UIKit expects content to respect the resulting left safe-area inset. **Texture
does not**: `ASTableView` measures its nodes against its own bounds, not its
adjusted content inset. Every comment measured 1032pt wide, got pushed right by
the inset, and ran off the right edge of the screen.

Fix shipped: `ApolloPaneColumnHostViewController` wraps the detail column's
navigation controller and pins it leading/trailing to the safe area (top/bottom
still to the view, so the nav bar keeps extending under the status bar). The
navigation controller's view is then genuinely only as wide as the uncovered
region, and Texture measures correctly with no changes to Apollo or ASDK.

**Generalize this.** Any column we add later inherits the same problem, and so
does any tweak-drawn UI placed in the secondary column. The rule is: never let
Texture content size itself from a view that the sidebar overlaps.

**But it is configuration-dependent, not universal.** The full-width-secondary
behavior above was measured on a **two-column** pane. On a **three-column** pane
with the primary hidden (the portrait downgrade), the same dump shows the
secondary properly *tiled* beside the feed:

```
supplementary  _UISplitViewControllerAdaptiveColumnView  (0.0,   0, 351.0, 1312)
secondary      _UISplitViewControllerAdaptiveColumnView  (351.5, 0, 680.5, 1312)
separator                                                (351.0, 0,   0.5, 1312)
```

The column host stays correct either way — when nothing overlaps, the safe area
*is* the full bounds, so pinning to it is a no-op. Do not assume one behavior
and design around it; read the frames.

**Measure column geometry from a hierarchy dump, never from a screenshot.** An
apparent "the feed column is only ~260pt and cramped in portrait" bug was chased
and a whole adaptive-width mechanism written for it, before a dump showed the
column was 351pt all along — exactly the configured
`minimumSupplementaryColumnWidth`. The 260 came from eyeballing cell padding as
the column edge, and from `primaryColumnWidth` (413), which reports the *hidden*
column and is irrelevant while it is hidden. The mechanism was reverted. Use
`echo dump > /tmp/apollofix-tap.txt` and read `_UISplitViewControllerAdaptiveColumnView`
frames.

### 5.3 Full-width chrome assumptions — **largest hidden cost**

- 19 tweak modules touch `navigationBar`.
- 33 tweak modules read `UIScreen.mainScreen`.

Modules that assume a single full-width nav bar need per-column awareness:
`ApolloImmersiveHeaderBackground`, `ApolloProgressiveBlur`,
`ApolloScrollEdgeEffect`, `ApolloLiquidGlass` (title centering),
`ApolloAutoHideTabBar`, `ApolloSubredditHeaders`, `ApolloSearchInPlace`.

This is very likely a bigger line-count cost than the split view controller
itself. `ApolloPaneChrome.xm` exists to hold the reconciliation, and the
`UIScreen.mainScreen` readers should migrate to the owning view's window/traits
regardless of this project — that migration is independently correct.

### 5.4a Testing constraint: the simulator runs against a LIVE account

The sim inner loop restores a real signed-in Reddit session, so **any scripted
gesture that lands on a post or comment performs a real action on that account**.
This was learned the hard way: a swipe issued to test column-boundary gestures
was consumed by Apollo's swipe-to-vote and cast a genuine downvote, and the
scripted tap bridge could not reliably reach the ASDK action button to undo it
(taps land on `_ASDisplayView` without activating the node).

Rules for the rest of this work:
- Gesture and interaction testing on feed/comment content needs a **throwaway
  Reddit account**, not the developer's own session.
- The tap bridge is fine for navigation chrome (tab bar, nav bar buttons,
  toggles) — those are idempotent. It is not safe for content rows.
- Prefer read-only verification (screenshots, hierarchy dumps, resolved-layout
  logs) over driving interactions whenever it answers the question.

### 5.4 Gesture conflicts — partly disproved by testing

**Update from measurement.** The prediction below was pessimistic. A leading-edge
drag *inside the detail column* did **not** trigger Apollo's interactive pop —
the gesture was consumed by Apollo's own swipe-to-vote on the comment row. So
the "every interior boundary has an Apollo edge recognizer on each side of it"
concern did not reproduce at the feed/detail boundary.

That is one boundary, one direction, on one layout, and the test could not be
repeated safely (§5.4a). Treat the analysis below as **unvalidated** rather than
either confirmed or refuted, and finish it on device with a throwaway account
before Phase 4.

The original analysis:

`ApolloNavigationController` installs a left screen-edge pan (interactive pop),
a **right screen-edge pan (go forward — confirmed: it re-pushes the tail of the
per-nav `poppedViewControllers` array)**, and a nav-bar pan for hide-on-swipe.
In a triple-column layout every interior column boundary therefore has an Apollo
recognizer on each side of it — the supplementary column's *right*-edge
(go-forward) pan sits exactly on the boundary with the secondary column, whose
*left*-edge (pop) pan sits on the same line — plus `UISplitViewController`'s own
`presentsWithGesture` show/hide pan on the primary edge. "Screen-edge" pans are
actually view-edge relative, so they will fire at column boundaries, not just
screen edges. Plan: disable Apollo's edge pans on interior edges (keep pop on
the leftmost visible column, drop go-forward inside columns — ⌘] still covers
it), and decide `presentsWithGesture` explicitly rather than inheriting it.
Also define the router's forward-stack policy: clear `poppedViewControllers` on
cross-column reroutes so "go forward" never resurrects a detail VC whose list
context is gone.

### 5.5 Entry points that must keep working

Deep links (`apollo://`), Siri intents, home-screen quick actions
(`ApolloQuickActions`), the settings router, the crash prompt coordinator, and
push notification taps all target the tab bar controller and then walk into a
navigation controller. All are covered by §5.1's helper, but each needs an
explicit smoke test — a deep link that lands in the wrong column is a worse bug
than one that fails outright.

### 5.6 What panes do *not* fix

[#635](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/635) (search bar
under the floating tab bar) disappears when panes are ON, because the floating
pill is hidden. It **still affects every iPad user who leaves panes OFF**, which
is the default. Folding it into this work means those users stay broken until
they opt in. If that becomes unacceptable before Phase 2 lands, pull it back out
as a standalone fix — `ApolloSearchHeaderOverlapFix.xm` already exists as the
natural home.

## 6. Implementation best practices

Rules distilled from the binary findings above plus Apple's iPad guidance
(the tab-bar/sidebar and desktop-class articles). These bind Phases 1–4.

**Split view API traps (learned the hard way)**

The first three were found while the Home tab was still three-column. That
column is gone (§3, §6a), so they no longer bite this branch — kept because they
are real UIKit behavior and the next person to reach for a triple column will
hit all three.

- `supplementaryColumnWidth` and its preferred/min/max siblings **throw** on a
  double-column split view: `"UISplitViewController supplementaryColumnWidth
  properties unsupported for style = DoubleColumn"`. Reading one in shared code
  that runs for every pane crashes the app the first time a two-column tab lays
  out. Guard every access on the pane actually being three-column. *(Still live:
  every pane is double-column now, so this property must never be read at all.)*
- `oneBesideSecondary` means *one*: in a three-column layout it shows one of
  primary/supplementary and **hides the other**. Three-column panes need
  `twoBesideSecondary`.
- UIKit treats `preferredDisplayMode` as a request and silently downgrades
  `twoBesideSecondary` → `oneBesideSecondary` when the width cannot take three
  tiles (measured: honored at 1366pt landscape, downgraded at 1032pt portrait on
  a 13" iPad). The downgrade hides the **primary** column, so any layout relying
  on three columns must ship a `showColumn:`/`hideColumn:` toggle or the sidebar
  becomes unreachable. This is what killed the hand-drawn destinations rail
  (§6a). Log the *resolved* `displayMode`/`splitBehavior` rather than trusting
  the preference.
- `displayModeButtonItem` renders as an empty capsule inside Apollo's Liquid
  Glass navigation bar — present and tappable, but with no glyph. If you ever
  need a column toggle of your own, use an explicit `UIBarButtonItem` with your
  own symbol and accent. *(Not needed today: UIKit's tab sidebar draws its own.)*

**Split view configuration**
- `UISplitViewController(style: .doubleColumn)`, `preferredSplitBehavior = .tile`,
  `preferredDisplayMode = .oneBesideSecondary`. Never `.overlay` for the list
  column — content panes that float over other content re-create the
  "blown-up iPhone app" feel this project exists to kill.
- Set `edgesForExtendedLayout = .all` **and**
  `extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars = true` on the pane, or UIKit reserves the
  tab bar's height and leaves a dead strip at the bottom (§3).
- Set `presentsWithGesture` deliberately (likely `false`), because Apollo's own
  edge pans occupy the same edges (§5.4).
- Let the system collapse/expand do the work. Implement
  `splitViewController(_:topColumnForCollapsingToProposedTopColumn:)` only to
  choose the surviving top VC; do not hand-merge stacks. On expand, rebuild
  columns from the router's classification of the collapsed stack.
- Hide the tab bar via the tab bar controller (`hidesBottomBarWhenPushed` /
  LG minimize APIs are irrelevant here) — the `ApolloTabBarController` object
  itself must keep existing untouched (§3).

**Routing**
- Intercept at the ObjC shim (`pushViewController:animated:`) and reroute by
  calling the destination nav's normal push — never splice `viewControllers`
  arrays. Apollo's Swift push body (dedupe, `extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars`,
  `pushing` flag, nav-bar re-show loop) must run on whichever nav actually hosts
  the VC (§2).
- Remove a VC from its source stack *before* pushing it elsewhere, or Apollo's
  duplicate-push guard silently eats later pushes of the same instance (§2).
- Never reroute modals, and never reroute during an in-flight transition
  (`pushing`/`popping` ivars are readable via `MSHookIvar` inside hooks).
- Clear the destination column's `poppedViewControllers` on cross-column
  reroutes (§5.4).

**Presentation**
- Tweak-drawn share sheets / alert-sheet presentations reachable from new column
  contexts must set popover `sourceView`/`sourceRect` (iPad hard requirement).
- Apollo's own card presentations center over the window, not the column (§2) —
  leave as-is for v1.

**Sizing & chrome**
- New tweak UI in panes must derive geometry from the owning view's bounds /
  window, never `UIScreen.mainScreen` — and §5.3's migration moves existing
  modules the same way.
- Per-column nav bars each resolve their own traits; resolve dynamic colors
  against the column's own view (`resolvedColorWithTraitCollection:`), the same
  rule the theme runtime already enforces for `.CGColor` uses.
- Readable width: cap the secondary column's content at ~`UIView.
  readableContentGuide` behavior for very wide windows rather than letting
  comments stretch edge-to-edge on a 13" landscape iPad.

**Desktop-class polish (Phase 4, iOS 16+ where available)**
- `UIFindInteraction` for comments search (`isFindInteractionEnabled` on the
  scroll view) instead of extending Apollo's hand-rolled search toolbar.
- `UINavigationItem.style = .browser` on the supplementary/secondary columns'
  nav items is worth an experiment for density; it is cosmetic and safely
  gated on `respondsToSelector:`.
- Keyboard focus follows the responder chain — route Apollo's existing
  `keyCommands` (`selectNextCell`, `goIntoCell`, `goBack`, `pageUp`, …) by
  making the focused column's nav controller first responder, not by
  duplicating the commands.

## 6a. RESOLVED: the destinations rail — UIKit's tab sidebar, option 2

This section previously recorded a blocked decision: a hand-drawn destinations
rail placed in a split view's primary column **disappears in portrait**, because
UIKit downgrades a three-column pane to `oneBesideSecondary` at 1032pt and hides
the primary column. With the floating tab bar retired there would have been no
way to switch tabs at all. Three options were tabled; option 1 (hide the tab bar
exactly when the sidebar is visible) was recommended, and the branch sat on
option 3 (no rail) in the meantime.

**Option 2 won, and the objection recorded against it was wrong.** The
objection was that `mode = .tabSidebar` "yields four columns in landscape (tab
sidebar + subreddits + feed + comments), which does not fit 1366pt". That is
true, and it is not a cost of the tab sidebar — it is a cost of *also* keeping a
subreddit column. Dropping that column is an improvement on its own terms (it
duplicated Apollo's "Home ⌄" title menu), so the constraint dissolved rather
than had to be paid.

What UIKit's sidebar gives that a hand-drawn rail could not:

- **Portrait solves itself.** UIKit collapses the sidebar into a floating tab
  bar with a reveal button — verified on an iPad Pro 13" in portrait. No custom
  adaptation logic, and no rotation-triggered appear/disappear to explain away,
  which was option 1's main cost.
- The system toggle between sidebar and tab bar, plus platform selection,
  hover, drag-and-drop and keyboard behavior, none of it written by us.
- One fixed sidebar for the whole app instead of a rail duplicated per tab —
  which was the other complaint about the original design.

The one genuine limit stands: **the tab sidebar is iOS 18+**. iOS 14–17 iPads
keep the floating tab bar beside the two-column panes. That is a coherent
layout, just a less native one, so the feature degrades rather than becoming
unavailable. Option 1 remains the fallback if that ever needs improving.

## 7. Open questions

1. ~~**Sidebar destinations rail styling.**~~ **Answered:** UIKit draws it
   (§6a). Nothing to style; it follows the platform.
2. **Detail column empty state.** Apollo has no "no post selected" artwork.
   Currently a themed symbol + label. The alternative is auto-selecting the
   first post on load (Mail's behavior), which costs a network fetch on every
   subreddit change. Unresolved, but the current state is shippable.
3. ~~**Does the sidebar persist across tabs visually?**~~ **Answered:** there is
   now literally one sidebar, owned by the tab bar controller, so the question
   no longer applies. Verified: switching to Inbox leaves the sidebar untouched
   and replaces only the content.
4. ~~**iOS 18+ `mode = .tabSidebar`** as an alternative destinations rail.~~
   **Answered:** it is not the alternative, it is the design (§6a).
5. **Should the subreddit list move into the sidebar?** UIKit renders a
   `UITabGroup`'s `children` as an expandable sidebar section, which is how
   Music lists playlists — the native home for "your communities". It would
   require projecting Apollo's favorites/multireddits into `UITab` objects and
   would lose the real list's Edit mode, A–Z index and sections. Not attempted;
   the list works well in the list column today. Revisit only if the sidebar
   feels sparse in use.
