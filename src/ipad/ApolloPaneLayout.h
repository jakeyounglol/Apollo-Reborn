//   Supported  — could this OS/device run panes? (iPadOS 18+ / iOS 27 phone)
//   Enabled    — did the user ask for it for THIS process? (read at %ctor)
//   Active     — did installation actually succeed and is it live right now?
//
// Modules must gate on Active. The user default is what the user wants at the
// NEXT launch: it changes the moment they flip the switch, while the running
// process still has whatever layout it installed at scene connect. Gating on
// the default would make every consumer disagree with reality for the rest of
// the session.
